The LA band began 2020 by touring in support of their record released the previous year,&nbsp;<\/span><em data-identifyelement=\"298\"><span data-identifyelement=\"299\">Widow&rsquo;s Weeds<\/span><\/em><span data-identifyelement=\"300\">. But the pandemic halted those plans, with the members including guitarist and singer Brian Aubert, bassist Nikki Monninger, drummer Christopher Guanlao, and keyboardist Joe Lester, finding themselves stuck at home. In that resting period, Aubert wasn&rsquo;t focused on Silversun Pickups; instead, he channeled his energy into taking care of his son, Nico, while his wife Tracy worked.<\/span><\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"301\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"302\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"303\"><span data-identifyelement=\"304\">But as much as his focus initially shifted from the band, he couldn&rsquo;t escape the new melodies germinating in his head. &ldquo;I would sneak off and start writing these songs, and I didn&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re for because I didn&rsquo;t really think about Silversun on any level. I was just doing it to keep myself calm and keep myself company,&rdquo; says Aubert. The songs were so different from what he&rsquo;d previously written for Silversun Pickups that he initially thought he was writing a musical. There were &ldquo;dream shanties,&rdquo; gentler vocals, horror-inspired sounds, and other exciting new elements coming to mind.<\/span><\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"305\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"306\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"307\"><span data-identifyelement=\"308\">The band finally was able to gather in person for a live-streamed acoustic performance on Halloween for The Dark Zone Network&rsquo;s virtual music festival Queen Mary, and it was there that Aubert revealed the new material to his bandmates. They readily embraced the new direction&mdash;and so did producer Butch Vig. The band reunited with Vig, who first worked with Silversun Pickups on&nbsp;<\/span><em data-identifyelement=\"309\"><span data-identifyelement=\"310\">Widow&rsquo;s Weeds<\/span><\/em><span data-identifyelement=\"311\">, recording the record at the famed producer and Garbage member&rsquo;s home.<\/span><\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"312\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"313\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"314\"><span data-identifyelement=\"315\">When Aubert first reached out to Vig, he wasn&rsquo;t sure if the band was making an EP or a full record;&nbsp;<\/span><em data-identifyelement=\"316\"><span data-identifyelement=\"317\">Widow&rsquo;s Weeds<\/span><\/em><span data-identifyelement=\"318\">&nbsp;was still fresh for Silversun Pickups. But once Aubert made plans to visit Vig and play him what he had, the music began pouring out. He immediately began recording with Vig, later having the rest of the band join.<\/span><\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"319\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"320\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"321\"><span data-identifyelement=\"322\">Once the band began working on&nbsp;<\/span><em data-identifyelement=\"323\"><span data-identifyelement=\"324\">Physical Thrills<\/span><\/em><span data-identifyelement=\"325\">&nbsp;together, they made some of Silversun Pickups&rsquo; most stunning songs yet. The record doesn&rsquo;t depart drastically from the sound the band&rsquo;s fans know and love, but rather enhances it with previously-unexplored fixtures at play.<\/span><\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"326\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"327\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"328\"><em data-identifyelement=\"329\"><span data-identifyelement=\"330\">Physical Thrills<\/span><\/em><span data-identifyelement=\"331\">&nbsp;was colored by the pandemic, but isn&rsquo;t meant to be solemn; instead, Aubert explores his own comfort in the temporary, newfound isolation. There&rsquo;s a juxtaposition of playfulness with angst from having so much time to process untapped emotions. That&rsquo;s something that comes through in the album&rsquo;s instrumentation, too, with wide-ranging sounds that transform according to the weight of the lyrics.<\/span><\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"332\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"333\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"334\"><span data-identifyelement=\"335\">There are tracks with shoegaze-infused distorted synths and guitar, like opener &ldquo;Stillness (Way Beyond)&rdquo;; bouncy, pop-tinged danceable tunes (&ldquo;Empty Nest,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hereafter (Way After)&rdquo;); pared-down ballads (&ldquo;Alone On A Hill&rdquo;); and a collection of &ldquo;dream shanties,&rdquo; as Aubert refers to them.<\/span><\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"336\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"337\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"338\"><span data-identifyelement=\"339\">The titles of those shanties call back to &ldquo;Dream At Tempo 119&rdquo; off the band&rsquo;s 2006 debut record,&nbsp;<\/span><em data-identifyelement=\"340\"><span data-identifyelement=\"341\">Carnavas<\/span><\/em><span data-identifyelement=\"342\">, tying the band&rsquo;s beginnings with the current, evolved iteration of Silversun Pickups. But, this time, the instrumentation matches the lyrics. Aubert forgoes the heavy guitars to instead create magical lullabies: &ldquo;Dream At Tempo 050,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dream At Tempo 310,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dream At Tempo 150.&rdquo; Each carries a secret code in the title with numbers personal to Aubert.<\/span><\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"343\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"344\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"345\"><span data-identifyelement=\"346\">With such an exploratory record, the band members felt free to traverse new ground. Guanlao, who usually shies away from fills on drums, took inspiration from The Beatles documentary&nbsp;<\/span><em data-identifyelement=\"347\"><span data-identifyelement=\"348\">Get Back<\/span><\/em><span data-identifyelement=\"349\">, throwing some into&nbsp;<\/span><em data-identifyelement=\"350\"><span data-identifyelement=\"351\">Physical Thrills<\/span><\/em><span data-identifyelement=\"352\">, influenced by Ringo Starr&rsquo;s work on&nbsp;<\/span><em data-identifyelement=\"353\"><span data-identifyelement=\"354\">Let It Be<\/span><\/em><span data-identifyelement=\"355\">. Whereas for Monninger, this record allowed her to showcase her vocals at the forefront more than in previous work. Joe also took a larger role in composition on this record, writing the piano part for &ldquo;We Won&rsquo;t Come Out,&rdquo; which became the backbone for the song.<\/span><\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"356\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"357\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"358\"><span data-identifyelement=\"359\">The making of&nbsp;<\/span><em data-identifyelement=\"360\"><span data-identifyelement=\"361\">Physical Thrills<\/span><\/em><span data-identifyelement=\"362\">&nbsp;also allowed for whimsical moments, including Aubert creating a distinct tapping noise by incorporating the sound of drumsticks hitting Vig&rsquo;s Grammy in &ldquo;Hidden Moon,&rdquo; and playfully pelting balloons at Monninger while she played &ldquo;Hereafter (Way After)&rdquo; on bass to create less tension.<\/span><\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"363\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"364\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"365\"><span data-identifyelement=\"366\">While this record features such an eclectic mix of melodies, each song is interconnected with each other, meant to be experienced as a whole body of work. &ldquo;All of our records are designed for people who want to listen to them all the way through and hopefully stick around with it,&rdquo; says Aubert. &ldquo;After a while, maybe you&rsquo;ll catch on to the little things&mdash;not just the [pattern of] the dream songs, but maybe you&rsquo;ll hear that, and you&rsquo;ll hear a melody from the first song in the last song. There are crossover things happening.&rdquo;<\/span><\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"367\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"368\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"369\"><span data-identifyelement=\"370\">Lester says, &ldquo;<\/span><em data-identifyelement=\"371\"><span data-identifyelement=\"372\">Physical Thrills<\/span><\/em><span data-identifyelement=\"373\">&nbsp;is exactly the record that we wanted to make, which I&rsquo;m really stoked about because sometimes you look back and think, &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s maybe not exactly how we would have done it&rsquo; when you go back and listen to it years later.&rsquo; But I feel really proud of this one. I think the songs that Nikki sings on are like the best ones we&rsquo;ve done for her to sing on. The lyrics are better than they&rsquo;ve ever been.&rdquo;<\/span><\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"374\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"375\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div data-identifyelement=\"376\"><span data-identifyelement=\"377\">Monninger adds, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been together for twenty-two years; it&rsquo;s really interesting that we still love doing this. We know that we&rsquo;re fortunate to still be together after all these years, seeking out the silver lining. I feel like we still have many more things to say, and we&rsquo;re so happy with how this album turned out.&rdquo;<\/span><\/div>","tier":null,"axsTicketedEvent":true,"safetyIcons":[],"safetyModalEnabled":false,"fanSkins":[],"eventRedirect":{"enabled":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/festivals\/529135"},"description":null,"minorCategoryId1":"10","minorCategoryId1Label":"Alternative

fifth album from Chicano Batman, Notebook Fantasy takes its title from a phenomenon likely\nfamiliar to anyone who feels outside the status quo: the act of spending your formative years\ndreaming up other worlds and realities in the pages of a notebook, exploring those possibilities with\na bold and wide-eyed freedom. Throughout the lifespan of the Los Angeles-bred band,\nvocalist\/lyricist Bardo, guitarist Carlos Ar\u00e9valo, and bassist Eduardo Arenas have followed their\nown visionary impulses to tremendous heights\u2014a journey that began with taking the stage at local\ndive bars and recently saw them co-headlining the legendary Hollywood Bowl. In the making of\nNotebook Fantasy, Chicano Batman doubled down on their hyper-creative tendencies, discovering\nnew dimensions of their prismatic musicality while infusing their lyrics with an unflinching honesty.\nWith its dizzying constellation of song forms and sounds\u2014including everything from arena-ready\nanthems to piano-driven balladry to psychedelic space odysseys\u2014the result is a body of work that\nsheds all inhibitions and fully reveals the sublime expanse of their musical imagination.\nProduced by John Congleton (St. Vincent, Erykah Badu) and partly recorded at the historic Sunset\nSound, Notebook Fantasy veers away from the subtler sensibilities of 2020\u2019s Invisible People and\nembraces a sonic approach Arenas refers to as \u201cpainting in primary colors.\u201d \u201cWe wanted to peel\nback all the fuzziness and compression, and create something big and punchy and clear that would\nstill hold up if you stripped it down to just a vocal and one instrument,\u201d says Ar\u00e9valo. \u201cOver the\nyears we\u2019ve all gotten better at executing a vision; we understand how to use our musicianship and\ninstrumentation and energy more deliberately so we can make the music we want to hear, and we\u2019re\nopen to working with other people to make that happen,\u201d adds Bardo. To that end, Chicano\nBatman enlisted more than a dozen guest musicians on Notebook Fantasy, such as esteemed string\narranger Jherek Bischoff (Angel Olsen, Regina Spektor). \u201cPlaying with all those seasoned musicians\nreally helped us to level up, and when I listen now there\u2019s so many cool moments within the\nsongs\u2014to me it\u2019s one of those records you can keep going back to and hear something you never\nnoticed before,\u201d says Ar\u00e9valo. \u201cIn a lot of ways this album is us realizing our potential, and getting\nto that point meant we all had to trust each other and let each other do our thing.\u201d\nAs the band explains, building that trust and receptivity required a total overhaul of their musical\nprocess. \u201cIn the past we\u2019d butt heads trying to filter each song through our individual style or\naesthetic\u2014there was a lot of, \u2018You brought this song in, but I\u2019m now going to do my thing on it,\u2019\u201d\nsays Ar\u00e9valo. \u201cThis time we allowed whoever started the track to direct the process, and the rest of\nus were there to bring their vision to life in the way that best served the song.\u201d Their most truly\ncollaborative work yet, Notebook Fantasy wholly reflects all the joy and pain and much-needed\ncatharsis that went into its creation. \u201cMy feeling is that if we\u2019re having fun making a song, the\naudience will pick up on that and have fun too,\u201d says Arenas. \u201cBut before we could have fun we had\nto let go of a lot of old resentments and have some difficult conversations.\u201d\nThe first duet in Chicano Batman history, a standout track called \u201cParallels\u201d arose from a series of\nwriting sessions where Bardo and Arenas worked out those grievances in real time. \u201cEduardo would\ncome over to my house and we\u2019d talk for hours about all our misgivings, all the stuff we\u2019ve been\nholding onto from the past, and then we\u2019d put it all into the lyrics,\u201d Bardo recalls. \u201cIt was this crazy\n\nback-and-forth where we were completely scathing with each other, and it turned out to be kind of\nrevolutionary for us.\u201d \u201cI remember pacing around at Bardo\u2019s place, coming up with lyrics and telling\nhim, \u2018Just go for it, man\u2014hit me where it hurts,\u2019\u201d Arenas continues. \u201cAnd some of those lines did\nhurt, but we needed them to. That\u2019s the depths we had to go to for this record.\u201d Initially sparked\nfrom a voice memo recorded by Arenas on his three-year-old son\u2019s detuned guitar, \u201cParallels\u201d\neventually morphed into a shapeshifting epic graced with cinematic strings, choir-like harmonies,\nand a bit of gorgeously sprawling guitar improvisation from Ar\u00e9valo\u2014a glowing example of\nChicano Batman\u2019s newly heightened mastery of their songwriting and sound.\nAll throughout Notebook Fantasy, Chicano Batman channel moments of lightning-in-a-bottle\ninspiration into songs that push into fantastically strange terrain yet remain rooted in raw emotion.\nBorn from a chord progression composed by Ar\u00e9valo while practicing guitar and bolstered by lyrics\nand vocals from Bardo, the album-opening \u201cLive Today\u201d emerges as an empowered meditation on\ncutting through the chaos and finding your own version of peace, building a gloriously bombastic\nmood with its slinky grooves and otherworldly synth. One of the album\u2019s most purely euphoric\ntracks, \u201cFly\u201d begins with a guitar hook by Ar\u00e9valo that was developed during a session revisiting\nmusic he began on a Prophet 6 synthesizer. The finished version swells into a lovestruck reverie lit\nup in gauzy textures and heavenly group vocals.\u00a0And on \u201cEra Primavera,\u201d Chicano Batman share a\nsymphonic love song inspired by Bardo\u2019s fascination with mid-century Spanish-language ballads,\nadorning the track with a swooning string section and soaring background harmonies supplied by\nMartha Gonz\u00e1lez of the influential Chicano rock group Quetzal with her son and two of his cousins,\ntransforming \u201cEra Primavera\u201d into a multigenerational family affair with an indelibly poignant\nimpact. \u201cI wrote that song thinking about a past relationship, and about all those romantic ballads\nthat I heard growing up because of my parents,\u201d says Bardo. \u201cIt\u2019s the music we all loved together,\nand I still feel very emotionally connected to it now.\u201d\nAnother song closely informed by Bardo\u2019s upbringing, \u201cLei L\u00e1\u201d began as a cumbia experiment\nplayed in reverse on a Tascam 244 four-track tape machine in Arenas\u2019 basement. Later, at Sunset\nSound, the band achieved a potent synergy by feverishly blending elements of cumbia and dancehall\nand \u201970s-era Nigerian funk, while Bardo delved deep into his Afro-Colombian roots and brought a\ndistinctly sensual, spiritual, and jovial ethos to the track\u2019s lyrical component. A full-tilt dance party in\nsong form, \u201cLei L\u00e1\u201d reaches a mind-bending ecstasy in its final moments, happily falling out of\nrhythm and landing in its own enchanted universe. \u201cMy mom\u2019s from Cartagena and she\u2019s 63-year-\nold now, but she dances with this incredible energy like you\u2019ve never seen before\u2014she\u2019s a live wire,\u201d\nsays Bardo. \u201cWith \u2018Lei L\u00e1\u2019 I was thinking about being onstage and bringing that same energy, so that\neveryone can feel the electricity.\u201d\nThanks in part to a live show that routinely leaves audiences elated and spellbound, Chicano Batman\nhave experienced a major growth in their fanbase since the release of Invisible People. With their latest\ntriumphs including a headlining spot at L.A.\u2019s iconic Forum in summer 2024, the band\u2019s massive\nappeal has much to do with a rare balance of boundless charisma and hard-won understanding of\nthe nuances of showmanship. \u201cI remember playing to about 10 people at a bar on a Monday night\nwhen we first started out, but we just kept working and growing everything from the ground up,\u201d\nsays Ar\u00e9valo, who joined Chicano Batman in 2011 after Bardo and Arenas co-founded the band in\n2008. \u201cNow we\u2019re at the point where we can look out at the audience at the Hollywood Bowl and\nsee people who\u2019ve been fans for 15 years, and they\u2019re there with their kids who are fans now too. It\u2019s\nbecome a generational thing, which feels really magical.\u201d\n\nFor Chicano Batman, the live set served as an essential touchstone throughout the making of\nNotebook Fantasy. \u201cI always want everyone to scream their hearts out at our shows, so one of the\nmain ideas behind this record was, \u2018Let\u2019s write songs that speak about love and pain in a very direct\nway that you can immediately feel in your soul,\u2019\u201d says Bardo. When matched with their refusal to\ndilute the diversity and magnitude of their sound, that approach ultimately led the band toward the\ntruest expression of their one-of-a-kind voice. \u201cMaking this album allowed us to stop reaching\ntoward anything besides being completely ourselves,\u201d Arenas says. \u201cWe believe we have something\nunique to speak to the world, so we focused on getting that across with confidence and conviction\ninstead of worrying about any outside noise. We want to be so untouchable that no one can take our\nshine away, and hopefully that\u2019ll help other people to shine too.\u201d","tier":null,"axsTicketedEvent":true,"safetyIcons":[],"safetyModalEnabled":false,"fanSkins":[],"eventRedirect":{"enabled":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/festivals\/526606"},"description":null,"minorCategoryId1":"10","minorCategoryId1Label":"Alternative

Chicano Batman, <em>Notebook Fantasy<\/em> takes its title from a phenomenon likely familiar to anyone who feels outside the status quo: the act of spending your formative years dreaming up other worlds and realities in the pages of a notebook, exploring those possibilities with a bold and wide-eyed freedom. Throughout the lifespan of the Los Angeles-bred band, vocalist\/lyricist Bardo, guitarist Carlos Ar&eacute;valo, and bassist Eduardo Arenas have followed their own visionary impulses to tremendous heights&mdash;a journey that began with taking the stage at local dive bars and recently saw them co-headlining the legendary Hollywood Bowl. In the making of <em>Notebook Fantasy<\/em>, Chicano Batman doubled down on their hyper-creative tendencies, discovering new dimensions of their prismatic musicality while infusing their lyrics with an unflinching honesty. With its dizzying constellation of song forms and sounds&mdash;including everything from arena-ready anthems to piano-driven balladry to psychedelic space odysseys&mdash;the result is a body of work that sheds all inhibitions and fully reveals the sublime expanse of their musical imagination.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Produced by John Congleton (St. Vincent, Erykah Badu) and partly recorded at the historic Sunset Sound, <em>Notebook Fantasy <\/em>veers away from the subtler sensibilities of 2020&rsquo;s <em>Invisible People<\/em> and embraces a sonic approach Arenas refers to as &ldquo;painting in primary colors.&rdquo; &ldquo;We wanted to peel back all the fuzziness and compression, and create something big and punchy and clear that would still hold up if you stripped it down to just a vocal and one instrument,&rdquo; says Ar&eacute;valo. &ldquo;Over the years we&rsquo;ve all gotten better at executing a vision; we understand how to use our musicianship and instrumentation and energy more deliberately so we can make the music we want to hear, and we&rsquo;re open to working with other people to make that happen,&rdquo; adds Bardo. To that end, Chicano Batman enlisted more than a dozen guest musicians on <em>Notebook Fantasy<\/em>, such as esteemed string arranger Jherek Bischoff (Angel Olsen, Regina Spektor). &ldquo;Playing with all those seasoned musicians really helped us to level up, and when I listen now there&rsquo;s so many cool moments within the songs&mdash;to me it&rsquo;s one of those records you can keep going back to and hear something you never noticed before,&rdquo; says Ar&eacute;valo. &ldquo;In a lot of ways this album is us realizing our potential, and getting to that point meant we all had to trust each other and let each other do our thing.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>As the band explains, building that trust and receptivity required a total overhaul of their musical process. &ldquo;In the past we&rsquo;d butt heads trying to filter each song through our individual style or aesthetic&mdash;there was a lot of, &lsquo;You brought this song in, but I&rsquo;m now going to do my thing on it,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Ar&eacute;valo. &ldquo;This time we allowed whoever started the track to direct the process, and the rest of us were there to bring their vision to life in the way that best served the song.&rdquo; Their most truly collaborative work yet, <em>Notebook Fantasy<\/em> wholly reflects all the joy and pain and much-needed catharsis that went into its creation. &ldquo;My feeling is that if we&rsquo;re having fun making a song, the audience will pick up on that and have fun too,&rdquo; says Arenas. &ldquo;But before we could have fun we had to let go of a lot of old resentments and have some difficult conversations.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The first duet in Chicano Batman history, a standout track called &ldquo;Parallels&rdquo; arose from a series of writing sessions where Bardo and Arenas worked out those grievances in real time. &ldquo;Eduardo would come over to my house and we&rsquo;d talk for hours about all our misgivings, all the stuff we&rsquo;ve been holding onto from the past, and then we&rsquo;d put it all into the lyrics,&rdquo; Bardo recalls. &ldquo;It was this crazy back-and-forth where we were completely scathing with each other, and it turned out to be kind of revolutionary for us.&rdquo; &ldquo;I remember pacing around at Bardo&rsquo;s place, coming up with lyrics and telling him, &lsquo;Just go for it, man&mdash;hit me where it hurts,&rsquo;&rdquo; Arenas continues. &ldquo;And some of those lines did hurt, but we needed them to. That&rsquo;s the depths we had to go to for this record.&rdquo; Initially sparked from a voice memo recorded by Arenas on his three-year-old son&rsquo;s detuned guitar, &ldquo;Parallels&rdquo; eventually morphed into a shapeshifting epic graced with cinematic strings, choir-like harmonies, and a bit of gorgeously sprawling guitar improvisation from Ar&eacute;valo&mdash;a glowing example of Chicano Batman&rsquo;s newly heightened mastery of their songwriting and sound.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>All throughout <em>Notebook Fantasy<\/em>, Chicano Batman channel moments of lightning-in-a-bottle inspiration into songs that push into fantastically strange terrain yet remain rooted in raw emotion. Born from a chord progression composed by Ar&eacute;valo while practicing guitar and bolstered by lyrics and vocals from Bardo, the album-opening &ldquo;Live Today&rdquo; emerges as an empowered meditation on cutting through the chaos and finding your own version of peace, building a gloriously bombastic mood with its slinky grooves and otherworldly synth. &nbsp;One of the album&rsquo;s most purely euphoric tracks, &ldquo;Fly&rdquo; begins with a guitar hook by Ar&eacute;valo that was developed during a session revisiting music he began on a Prophet 6 synthesizer. The finished version swells into a lovestruck reverie lit up in gauzy textures and heavenly group vocals.<em>&nbsp;<\/em>And on &ldquo;Era Primavera,&rdquo; Chicano Batman share a symphonic love song inspired by Bardo&rsquo;s fascination with mid-century Spanish-language ballads, adorning the track with a swooning string section and soaring background harmonies supplied by Martha Gonz&aacute;lez of the influential Chicano rock group Quetzal with her son and two of his cousins, transforming &ldquo;Era Primavera&rdquo; into a multigenerational family affair with an indelibly poignant impact. &ldquo;I wrote that song thinking about a past relationship, and about all those romantic ballads that I heard growing up because of my parents,&rdquo; says Bardo. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the music we all loved together, and I still feel very emotionally connected to it now.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Another song closely informed by Bardo&rsquo;s upbringing, &ldquo;Lei L&aacute;&rdquo; began as a cumbia experiment played in reverse on a Tascam 244 four-track tape machine in Arenas&rsquo; basement. Later, at Sunset Sound, the band achieved a potent synergy by feverishly blending elements of cumbia and dancehall and &rsquo;70s-era Nigerian funk, while Bardo delved deep into his Afro-Colombian roots and brought a distinctly sensual, spiritual, and jovial ethos to the track&rsquo;s lyrical component. A full-tilt dance party in song form, &ldquo;Lei L&aacute;&rdquo; reaches a mind-bending ecstasy in its final moments, happily falling out of rhythm and landing in its own enchanted universe. &ldquo;My mom&rsquo;s from Cartagena and she&rsquo;s 63-year-old now, but she dances with this incredible energy like you&rsquo;ve never seen before&mdash;she&rsquo;s a live wire,&rdquo; says Bardo. &ldquo;With &lsquo;Lei L&aacute;&rsquo; I was thinking about being onstage and bringing that same energy, so that everyone can feel the electricity.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Thanks in part to a live show that routinely leaves audiences elated and spellbound, Chicano Batman have experienced a major growth in their fanbase since the release of <em>Invisible People<\/em>. With their latest triumphs including a headlining spot at L.A.&rsquo;s iconic Forum in summer 2024, the band&rsquo;s massive appeal has much to do with a rare balance of boundless charisma and hard-won understanding of the nuances of showmanship. &ldquo;I remember playing to about 10 people at a bar on a Monday night when we first started out, but we just kept working and growing everything from the ground up,&rdquo; says Ar&eacute;valo, who joined Chicano Batman in 2011 after Bardo and Arenas co-founded the band in 2008. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re at the point where we can look out at the audience at the Hollywood Bowl and see people who&rsquo;ve been fans for 15 years, and they&rsquo;re there with their kids who are fans now too. It&rsquo;s become a generational thing, which feels really magical.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>For Chicano Batman, the live set served as an essential touchstone throughout the making of <em>Notebook Fantasy<\/em>. &ldquo;I always want everyone to scream their hearts out at our shows, so one of the main ideas behind this record was, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s write songs that speak about love and pain in a very direct way that you can immediately feel in your soul,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Bardo. When matched with their refusal to dilute the diversity and magnitude of their sound, that approach ultimately led the band toward the truest expression of their one-of-a-kind voice. &ldquo;Making this album allowed us to stop reaching toward anything besides being completely ourselves,&rdquo; Arenas says. &ldquo;We believe we have something unique to speak to the world, so we focused on getting that across with confidence and conviction instead of worrying about any outside noise. We want to be so untouchable that no one can take our shine away, and hopefully that&rsquo;ll help other people to shine too.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<div><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; word-break: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; font-size: 14px; text-size-adjust: auto; color: #333333; font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;\"><br \/><\/span><\/div>","shortBio":null,"aliases":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/artists\/1100568\/chicano-batman-tickets","urlSlug":"chicano-batman-tickets","externalPartnerID":{},"media":{"103":{"media_id":"3852044","width":860,"height":400,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2017\/06\/chicano-batman_06-03-17_103_593203af96968.jpg"},"19":{"media_id":"4841647","width":678,"height":399,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/01\/chicano-batman_01-11-24_19_65a07445d2477.jpg"},"5":{"media_id":"4841648","width":318,"height":187,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/01\/chicano-batman_01-11-24_5_65a074460702b.jpg"},"6":{"media_id":"4841649","width":238,"height":140,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/01\/chicano-batman_01-11-24_6_65a0744620f7d.jpg"},"9":{"media_id":"4841650","width":134,"height":79,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/01\/chicano-batman_01-11-24_9_65a074463ad91.jpg"},"20":{"media_id":"4841651","width":564,"height":564,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/01\/chicano-batman_01-11-24_20_65a074465cbae.jpg"},"7":{"media_id":"4841652","width":220,"height":220,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/01\/chicano-batman_01-11-24_7_65a074467e8f1.jpg"},"24":{"media_id":"4841653","width":322,"height":322,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/01\/chicano-batman_01-11-24_24_65a074469d6cf.jpg"},"88":{"media_id":"4841654","width":1200,"height":628,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/01\/chicano-batman_01-11-24_88_65a07446becc5.jpg"}},"city":null,"state":null,"country":"United States","countryCode":"US","tier":null,"eventDisplay":1,"events":[],"fanClubs":[],"links":[{"link_id":"990982","link_title":"Official Website","link_type_id":"8","link_href":"http:\/\/chicanobatman.com\/","link_target":"_blank"},{"link_id":"990983","link_title":"Twitter","link_type_id":"13","link_href":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/chicanobatman","link_target":"_blank"},{"link_id":"990984","link_title":"Youtube VEVO","link_type_id":"14","link_href":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/chicanobatman","link_target":"_blank"},{"link_id":"990985","link_title":"Facebook Page","link_type_id":"12","link_href":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/chicanobatman","link_target":"_blank"},{"link_id":"990986","link_title":"Instagram","link_type_id":"49","link_href":"http:\/\/instagram.com\/chicanobatman","link_target":"_blank"},{"link_id":"1050508","link_title":"Featured Video","link_type_id":"15","link_href":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3sOXiL05VSY","link_target":"_blank"}]}],"supportingActs":[{"performerId":"1110696","active":true,"locale":"en-US","localeAvailable":{"1":"en-US"},"name":"Lido Pimienta","under21":false,"minorCategoryText":"Latin","minorCategoryId":"24","minorCategory1Id":"24","minorCategory2Text":"Indie \/ Emo","minorCategory2Id":"21","minorCategory3Text":"Dance \/ Electronic","minorCategory3Id":"17","minorCategoryUrl":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/browse\/music\/latin","majorCategoryText":"Music","majorCategory2Text":"Music","majorCategory3Text":"Music","major_category_id":"2","majorCategory1Id":"2","majorCategory2Id":"2","majorCategory3Id":"2","majorCategoryUrl":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/browse\/music","keywords":["Latin Alternative","Latino Alternativo","Afro-Latin","Cumbia","rap latino","electronic","pop","contemporary","synthpop","indigenous"],"createFacebookEvent":true,"bio":"<div>Lido Pimienta's new album Miss Colombia, the anticipated follow-up to La Papessa, which was awarded the Polaris Music Prize in 2017, is available now. The Colombian-born, Toronto-based global beats trailblazer recorded the album in her home studio, with some additional recording done in the historic Colombian town of San Basilio de Palenque. Miss Colombia boasts 11 new and original songs that boldly celebrate Lido&rsquo;s ecstatic musical hybridity of electronic meets cumbia, and is at once defiant and delicate, exploratory and confrontational. All of the songs were written and arranged by Lido, and she co-produced the album with Matt Smith aka Prince Nifty.<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>The album title was partly inspired by the Miss Universe gaffe in 2015, when Steve Harvey mistakenly awarded the crown to Miss Colombia instead of Miss Philippines. It caused Lido to reflect on the anti-blackness she's experienced, and how she was viewed as an outsider in adolescence, a \"weird artistic tomboy\" for not adhering to the expected norms projected upon her. Lido - an Afro-Indigenous, queer feminist - created Miss Colombia as a canvas for introspection, with pieces about love (and self-love), and loss. Other songs confront divisive politics in Colombia, Indigenous inequality and racism, and ultimately to bring her closer to home.<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>Musically it digs deeply into the history of Afro-Latin musics, from Palenque to cumbia - styles that Lido embraced after being introduced to Sexteto Tabala, one of the most representative musical expressions of the African communities in Colombia (who are also featured on the album). The album also features Bomba Estereo&rsquo;s Li Saumet. Lido has an affinity for acts like A Tribe Called Red and Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq, but her work also resonates with British-Sri Lankan rapper MIA and she draws unabashed inspiration from the New York-bred Dominican-Trinidadian rap queen Cardi B.<\/div>","shortBio":null,"aliases":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/artists\/1110696\/lido-pimienta-tickets","urlSlug":"lido-pimienta-tickets","externalPartnerID":{},"media":{"19":{"media_id":"4422891","width":678,"height":399,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2021\/11\/lido-pimienta_11-17-21_19_619551da96466.png"},"5":{"media_id":"4422892","width":318,"height":187,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2021\/11\/lido-pimienta_11-17-21_5_619551dace26d.png"},"6":{"media_id":"4422893","width":238,"height":140,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2021\/11\/lido-pimienta_11-17-21_6_619551daf2d1f.png"},"9":{"media_id":"4422894","width":134,"height":79,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2021\/11\/lido-pimienta_11-17-21_9_619551db24d54.png"},"20":{"media_id":"4422895","width":564,"height":564,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2021\/11\/lido-pimienta_11-17-21_20_619551db6871a.png"},"7":{"media_id":"4422896","width":220,"height":220,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2021\/11\/lido-pimienta_11-17-21_7_619551db9b139.png"},"24":{"media_id":"4422897","width":322,"height":322,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2021\/11\/lido-pimienta_11-17-21_24_619551dbc8d38.png"},"88":{"media_id":"4422898","width":1200,"height":628,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2021\/11\/lido-pimienta_11-17-21_88_619551dc1925d.png"}},"city":null,"state":null,"country":"United

prisons enforce police states, where nonviolent offenders languish for decades. Pharmaceuticals numb the mind. Social media distracts the spirit. All while the very planet lurches toward an inevitable climate disaster that will extinguish humanity. The Nightmare of Human Organ Harvesting? That&rsquo;s not a gruesome song title from some forgotten old-school death metal record. It&rsquo;s a headline from the <em>Wall Street Journal<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Against this backdrop of postmodern dystopia, chaos, and confusion, arrives <em>Human Target<\/em>, the earth-scorching fifth album from extreme metal titans <strong>THY ART IS MURDER<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>Australia&rsquo;s most brutally alarming cultural export since George Miller&rsquo;s Mad Max franchise makes music that serves as a loud last gasp against the ever-encroaching void. It&rsquo;s a blazing light of nihilistic despondency before the final darkness. Fusing authentic crushing death metal with blackened fury and flashes of knuckle-dragging stomp, <strong>THY ART IS MURDER <\/strong>exorcise the pangs of mortality and the pains of socio-political trauma.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a reinvigoration and redefinition of a thriving subculture that has earned them a place in the Top 50 Most Popular Metal Bands Right Now, According to the Internet, a list compiled by a popular metal blog (based on worldwide page views) that puts <strong>THY ART IS MURDER<\/strong> among Metallica, Slipknot, Slayer, Megadeth, Ghost, and Iron Maiden.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>THY ART IS MURDER<\/strong>&rsquo;s thinking-person&rsquo;s blackened death metal has challenged and inspired audiences around the globe, from top-tier genre festivals like Download, Graspop, Hellfest, and Summer Breeze; to high-profile tours supporting Killswitch Engage, Parkway Drive, and Architects; to multiple headlining and co-headlining shows. In their native country, they&rsquo;ve charted higher than any other homegrown extreme metal band. They even toured North America with Slayer as part of Rockstar Mayhem.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Guitarist\/cofounder Sean Delander, guitarist\/lyricist Andy Marsh, singer Chris &ldquo;CJ&rdquo; McMahon, and bassist Kevin Butler officially welcome drummer Jesse Beahler (Jungle Rot, Black Crown Initiate, Rings Of Saturn) into the fold with <em>Human Target<\/em>, who brought a groovy yet technical approach to the proceedings. Marsh and Delander wrote the songs in just a few short weeks, with producer Will Putney once again at the helm.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>THY ART IS MURDER<\/strong> continues to rail against the anti-intellectualism and fear of mortality at the heart of some of the worst of public policy. In contrast with their impressive back catalog, no song on <em>Human Target<\/em> singles out organized religion or the concept of God specifically. The title track is about the practice of organ harvesting in China, where the World Heath Organization found a huge discrepancy in the number of organs volunteered by donors and the number of organs transplanted into the wealthy.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Make America Hate Again&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t intended to alienate any of the leftist band&rsquo;s more right leaning audience members; it&rsquo;s an attack against the entire political system, satirizing the expectation that any government will make things &ldquo;great&rdquo; for the masses.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;New Gods&rdquo; is about the role of social media in the mental health epidemic. &ldquo;Death Squad Anthem&rdquo; champions the youth who are fed up with the current system. &ldquo;Atonement&rdquo; is both a brutal examination concerning the truth of sexual violence, most of which goes unreported, and a literal atonement of sorts for some of the band&rsquo;s less thoughtful lyrics, around the time of the original lineup&rsquo;s formation a dozen years ago.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Welcome Oblivion,&rdquo; inspired by a line from the late Christopher Hitchens&rsquo; <em>Mortality<\/em>, likens humankind to a &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; upon the planet. &ldquo;Eye for an Eye&rdquo; subversively ascribes a patient vengeance to the earth, an earth that will survive the &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; of humanity. &ldquo;Voyeurs into Death&rdquo; attacks the surveillance state and for-profit-prisons. &ldquo;Chemical Christ&rdquo; is about the religion of addiction, from pharmaceuticals to &ldquo;smart&rdquo; phones.<\/p>\r\n<p>The fifth full-length from <strong>THY ART IS MURDER<\/strong> follows the blistering <em>Dear Desolation<\/em> (2017), which debuted in the Top 100 in the US and Australia&rsquo;s Top 5. They continue along an evolutionary trajectory charted by The Depression Sessions, an unprecedented collaborative album with The Acacia Strain and Fit For An Autopsy. That project arrived after the uncompromising <em>Holy War<\/em> (2015), <em>Hate<\/em> (2012), and <em>The Adversary<\/em> (2010).<\/p>\r\n<p>A fresh generation of extreme music acolytes and longstanding death metal fans alike enthusiastically endorse the unrelenting aggression and increasing lyrical depth of <strong>THY ART IS MURDER<\/strong>. Videos for &ldquo;Puppet Master,&rdquo; &ldquo;Holy War,&rdquo; &ldquo;No Absolution,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Purest Strain of Hate,&rdquo; &ldquo;Shadow of Eternal Sin,&rdquo; &ldquo;They Will Know Another,&rdquo; and &nbsp;&ldquo;Light Bearer&rdquo; have accumulated 40 million views, 13 million of them for &ldquo;Reign of Darkness&rdquo; alone.<\/p>\r\nIf this is truly the soundtrack to the end of humanity, it&rsquo;s music that should unite and empower extreme metal fans in all corners of the genre. This is underground music for the people, carrying the torch for a primal style that doesn&rsquo;t die. As <em>New Noise<\/em> declared, &ldquo;few embrace the feel of the apocalypse so dearly and expertly&hellip; <strong>THY ART IS MURDER<\/strong> is clearly at the head of the modern death metal pack [and] they are just getting better.&rdquo;","tier":null,"axsTicketedEvent":true,"safetyIcons":[],"safetyModalEnabled":false,"fanSkins":[],"eventRedirect":{"enabled":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/festivals\/529114"},"description":null,"minorCategoryId1":"28","minorCategoryId1Label":"Other","minorCategoryId2":null,"minorCategoryId2Label":null,"minorCategoryId3":null,"minorCategoryId3Label":null,"majorCategoryId1":"2","majorCategoryId1Label":"Music","majorCategoryId2":null,"majorCategoryId2Label":null,"majorCategoryId3":null,"majorCategoryId3Label":null,"venue":{"venueId":"125119","active":true,"distanceMiles":null,"distanceKilometers":null,"locale":"en-US","localeAvailable":{"1":"en-US"},"title":"The

As the third in a trilogy of records loosely based around J.M Barrie&rsquo;s Peter Pan, <strong>&lsquo;ETERNITY, IN YOUR ARMS&rsquo;<\/strong> sees the band wrestling with existential crises, personal failures and emotional desolation via the kaleidoscope of a richly drawn narrative tapestry.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\"><em>&ldquo;<\/em><em>With [2015&rsquo;s] The Callous Heart EP we wrote a bunch of heart-broken love songs based around Peter Pan&rsquo;s The Lost Boys,&rdquo;<\/em> explains singer <strong>Will Gould<\/strong>. <em>&ldquo;<\/em><em>The Stranger EP was full of more fearful songs about the things that terrify us &ndash; linking back to the Tick Tock Croc. With the album there is a combination of both of those things, but the majority of the record is about addressing those concerns &ndash; things we&rsquo;ve been through in our real lives - from a very immediate, present standpoint.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">The main human protagonist of &lsquo;Eternity&hellip;&rsquo; is <em>James Scythe<\/em>, a private investigator who travels to the South Coast to debunk the legend of &lsquo;<em>The Stranger&rsquo;<\/em> as well as putting his own demons to rest - but then mysteriously disappears. Such is the detailed, immersive experience that the band &ndash; completed by guitarists <strong>Ian Miles<\/strong> and <strong>Oliver Burdett<\/strong>, bassist <strong>Sean Scott<\/strong>, drummer <strong>Dan Bratton<\/strong> and keyboard player \/vocalist <strong>Hannah<\/strong> <strong>Greenwood<\/strong> &ndash; have built in the mere two years since their inception, that fans know not only the hotel <em>Scythe<\/em> stayed at in Southampton but the specific room number, as well as having access to a library of podcasts by him and a network of websites he frequented before seemingly vanishing into thin air.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">It should be abundantly clear by now that <strong>CREEPER<\/strong> is not just a band &ndash; it is a labyrinthine rabbit hole of a world as populated, detailed and dense as your imagination is prepared to make it.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\"><em>&ldquo;<\/em><em>Building this immersive world that people can fully engage in has always been an ambition for us,&rdquo;<\/em> confirms <strong>Gould<\/strong>. <em>&ldquo;<\/em><em>We want people to be able to almost physically step into what we&rsquo;ve created; to see The Stranger and James Scythe right in front of them. We have been meticulous with those ideas&rdquo;.&nbsp; <\/em>Indeed, the band&rsquo;s aesthetic is a precisely honed blend, which draws on everything from the surreal flair of David Lynch to the sci-fi shock of The X-Files, the gut-twisting horror of The Exorcist, the camp technicolor of Baz Luhrmann&rsquo;s Romeo and Juliet and much more besides.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">The soundtrack to this world is equally diverse. Ostensibly a punk band, <strong>CREEPER<\/strong>&rsquo;s sonic palette draws on everything from <em>Alkaline Trio<\/em> and <em>Jawbreaker<\/em> to <em>Meatloaf<\/em>, <em>David Bowie<\/em> and <em>Queen<\/em>. Take debut single <strong>&lsquo;<\/strong><strong>Suzanne<\/strong><strong>&rsquo;<\/strong>, for example - a song already championed by none other than <strong>Elton John<\/strong>. <em>&ldquo;&rsquo;<\/em><em>Suzanne<\/em><em>&rsquo; has many different elements to it,&rdquo;<\/em> says <strong>Gould<\/strong>. <em>&ldquo;<\/em><em>There are nods to lots of different things in there: the sex noises in the middle eight, a chorus that sounds like it&rsquo;s from The Rocky Horror Picture Show, an Offspring verse and moments that are almost pantomime. It encapsulates the aspiration and variety of the record in one song.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">It&rsquo;s a variety that is reflected at every turn across 11 bold, brave anthems - no more so than on majestic slow-burn of closer <strong>&lsquo;I Choose To Live&rsquo;<\/strong>. &nbsp;<em>&ldquo;<\/em><em>It&rsquo;s one of the most personal, emotional songs we&rsquo;ve ever written and the only time we come away from metaphor and simile and really address our audience directly,&rdquo; <\/em>surmises <strong>Gould<\/strong>. <em>&ldquo;Writing a song specifically for a person or a group of people is a challenging experience, but we wanted to offer them that. I want our band to be a safe, caring space where people can get some respite from whatever is ailing them.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Elsewhere, religious imagery abounds across <strong>&lsquo;Hiding With Boys&rsquo;<\/strong>, with Gould warning us in his ever-distinctive baritone that <em>&ldquo;<\/em><em>Heaven knows\/Hell&rsquo;s gates are near&rdquo;.<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\"><em>&ldquo;<\/em><em>I was listening to Arcade Fire&rsquo;s &lsquo;<\/em><em>Neon Bible<\/em><em>&rsquo; a lot during the writing process, &rdquo;<\/em> he notes. <em>&ldquo;<\/em><em>And there is a lot of religious imagery on &lsquo;Eternity&hellip;&rsquo;, particularly<\/em><em> purgatory<\/em><em>.The physical manifestation of having to deal with what befalls you.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Yet <strong>CREEPER<\/strong>&rsquo;s stylistic leaps are not limited to thematic through lines or punk-goes-flamboyant posturing: they are considerably more wide-ranging. &ldquo;<em>We wanted to draw from a place that wasn&rsquo;t just focused on the contemporary but brought in traditional songwriting techniques,&rdquo;<\/em> says <strong>Gould<\/strong>. <em>&ldquo;<\/em><em>The way those songs you hear when you&rsquo;re at a wedding or a birthday work &ndash; those songs that are in the collective consciousness. What&rsquo;s been really fun has been our development as a group. When you think of a band like Fleetwood Mac you think about a broader collective of musicians all contributing and that&rsquo;s what we wanted too.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Certainly, the rich orchestration that characterizes &lsquo;Eternity&hellip;&rsquo; &ndash; everything from trumpets and strings, to keys, spoken word poetry and close vocal harmonies is testament to this drive, but nowhere is it more strongly realised than on <strong>&lsquo;Crickets&rsquo;<\/strong>, a song which sees keyboardist <strong>Hannah Greenwood<\/strong> come to the fore for a stark, stripped-back and utterly affecting &nbsp;vocal performance.<em>&ldquo;<\/em><em>It&rsquo;s my favourite song on the album&rdquo;<\/em> admits <strong>Gould<\/strong>. <em>&ldquo;<\/em><em>It crosses a lot of personal boundaries for us. Hannah&rsquo;s contribution on this album as a multi-instrumentalist has been enormous and I think that song is one that will stand out for people.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Yet there is plenty that long-term fans will acknowledge as familiar here too, <strong>&lsquo;Room 309&rsquo;<\/strong> (<em>James Scythe<\/em>&rsquo;s aforementioned hotel residence) finds the band in an adrenaline-fuelled sprint, before opening up into a deftly-plucked duet, while <strong>&lsquo;<\/strong><strong>Darling<\/strong><strong>&rsquo;<\/strong> ably demonstrates a mastery of four chord punk songwriting that the band have now sharpened to a laser-guided point. It is a canvas painted with the unashamedly bold strokes and in a multitude of colours.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">Perhaps most pleasingly, <strong>CREEPER<\/strong> have not simply re-hashed the past glories of their two (glowingly received) EPs, but sought the kind of self-reinvention. There is a truth, honesty, lyrical skill, musical guile and skyscraping purpose coursing through these 11 songs which is almost impossible to ignore. With one of the fastest growing and most rabidly dedicated fanbases around, <strong>CREEPER<\/strong> are energetic, eccentric and, once you suspend your disbelief and enter their world, utterly compelling.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\"><em>&ldquo;In some ways, literally everything is a pantomime with us,&rdquo;<\/em> concludes <strong>Gould<\/strong>. <em>&ldquo;But that is our way of drawing you in so we can talk about all these things that really matter. These are story telling devices and that is the sleight of hand we are always trying to play. We are trying to put a coin in your hand and make it disappear right in front of you.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"Body\">And with burgeoning recognition and indelible artistic vision already the order of the day one thing is for sure &ndash; there is definitely something magical happening.&nbsp;<\/p>","shortBio":null,"aliases":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/artists\/258499\/creeper-tickets","urlSlug":"creeper-tickets","externalPartnerID":{},"media":{"24":{"media_id":"3876827","width":322,"height":322,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2017\/07\/creeper_07-25-17_24_5977b0740c04b.jpg"},"7":{"media_id":"3876826","width":220,"height":220,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2017\/07\/creeper_07-25-17_7_5977b073e75af.jpg"},"20":{"media_id":"3876825","width":564,"height":564,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2017\/07\/creeper_07-25-17_20_5977b0739a9ac.jpg"}},"city":null,"state":null,"country":null,"countryCode":null,"tier":null,"eventDisplay":1,"events":[],"fanClubs":[],"links":[{"link_id":"1061150","link_title":"Creeper

been the subject and willing conspirator of many intentional lies planted in Sonic Youth bios over the years, I know first hand the way album lore can bend reality to its truth. After the infamous Byron Coley originated the SY &ldquo;Trilogy&rdquo; myth in the Murray Street bio, we had no choice but to fulfill those expectations with Sonic Nurse. &ldquo;Why did you decide to make a trilogy?&rdquo; was always the first question asked in interviews around that time.<\/p>\r\n<p>But this is Kurt Vile&rsquo;s bio, and I wont do that to him. Anyway, Kurt does his own myth making; a boy\/man with an old soul voice in the age of digital everything becoming something else, which is why this focused, brilliantly clear and seemingly candid record is a breath of fresh air. Recorded and mixed in a number of locations, including Los Angeles and Joshua Tree,&nbsp;<strong><em>b&rsquo;lieve i&rsquo;m goin down&hellip;<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;is a handshake across the country, east to west coast, thru the dustbowl history (&ldquo;valley of ashes&rdquo;) of woody honest strait forward talk guthrie, and a cali canyon dead still nite floating in a nearly waterless landscape. The record is all air, weightless, bodyless, but grounded in convincing authenticity, in the best version of singer songwriter upcycling. In Kurt&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;I wanted to get back into the habit of writing a sad song on my couch, with nobody waiting on me. I really wanted it to&nbsp;<em>sound<\/em>&nbsp;like it&rsquo;s on my couch &mdash; not in a lo-fi way, just more unguarded and vulnerable.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>For a record that plays like a cohesive acoustic experience, its musicality marks Kurt&rsquo;s departure from an electric guitar experience to include a range of instrumentation with a large group of players. From the banjo he plays on &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an Outlaw&rdquo; to the piano and lapsteel on &ldquo;Life Like This,&rdquo; and the myriad other instruments on other songs, including farfisa, resonator, arps, horns and synth, one never thinks about what exactly yr listening to as it all serves the song.\u2028\u2028The heart of the record is &ldquo;Stand Inside.&rdquo; The music is quiet and the melody, like a hymn, folds in on itself, and embraces full strength in a sexy, floating forcelessness that slowly gathers into a wave that doesn&rsquo;t go where you think it will or rather gives in to itself and celebrates a man willing to be defined by a woman and his love for her as witness to each other&rsquo;s lives&hellip;&nbsp;<em>Don&rsquo;t stand by my side, stand inside<\/em>&nbsp;gives up roleplaying for true exposure and vulnerability.<\/p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a weird, accepting, mature record, acknowledging the inherent immaturity of being a person whether father, husband, partner,

and we didn't do it alone, we've had all these other people supporting us along the way.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Celebrating our 25th anniversary isn't self-congratulatory,&rdquo; Ragan summarizes. &ldquo;It's the band saying, 'Look at what all of us built and let's celebrate that.'&rdquo;<\/p>","shortBio":null,"aliases":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/artists\/105649\/hot-water-music-tickets","urlSlug":"hot-water-music-tickets","externalPartnerID":{},"media":{"19":{"media_id":4863806,"width":678,"height":399,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/02\/hot-water-music_02-13-24_19_65cb8b04505a6.jpg"},"5":{"media_id":4863807,"width":318,"height":187,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/02\/hot-water-music_02-13-24_5_65cb8b0484c32.jpg"},"6":{"media_id":4863808,"width":238,"height":140,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/02\/hot-water-music_02-13-24_6_65cb8b049f3c4.jpg"},"9":{"media_id":4863809,"width":134,"height":79,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/02\/hot-water-music_02-13-24_9_65cb8b04bdadb.jpg"},"20":{"media_id":4863810,"width":564,"height":564,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/02\/hot-water-music_02-13-24_20_65cb8b04d7e7e.jpg"},"7":{"media_id":4863811,"width":220,"height":220,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/02\/hot-water-music_02-13-24_7_65cb8b050974b.jpg"},"24":{"media_id":4863812,"width":322,"height":322,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/02\/hot-water-music_02-13-24_24_65cb8b0522a15.jpg"},"88":{"media_id":4863813,"width":1200,"height":628,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2024\/02\/hot-water-music_02-13-24_88_65cb8b05430e4.jpg"}},"city":null,"state":null,"country":"United States","countryCode":"US","tier":null,"eventDisplay":1,"events":[],"fanClubs":[],"links":[{"link_id":"916306","link_title":"Official Website","link_type_id":"8","link_href":"http:\/\/www.hotwatermusic.com\/","link_target":"_none"},{"link_id":"934327","link_title":"Amazon","link_type_id":"11","link_href":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Hot-Water-Music\/e\/B000AQ1EDQ\/ref=ntt_mus_dp_pel","link_target":"_none"},{"link_id":"915324","link_title":"Facebook Page","link_type_id":"12","link_href":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hotwatermusic","link_target":"_none"},{"link_id":"918799","link_title":"Twitter","link_type_id":"13","link_href":"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/HotWaterMusic","link_target":"_none"},{"link_id":"917617","link_title":"Featured Video","link_type_id":"15","link_href":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mUbX8OXo74c","link_target":"_none"},{"link_id":"933720","link_title":"Youtube VEVO","link_type_id":"14","link_href":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/HotWaterMusicVideo","link_target":"_none"}]}],"supportingActs":[{"performerId":"170","active":true,"locale":"en-US","localeAvailable":{"1":"en-US"},"name":"Quicksand","under21":false,"minorCategoryText":"Other","minorCategoryId":"28","minorCategory1Id":"28","minorCategory2Text":null,"minorCategory2Id":null,"minorCategory3Text":null,"minorCategory3Id":null,"minorCategoryUrl":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/browse\/music\/other","majorCategoryText":"Music","majorCategory2Text":null,"majorCategory3Text":null,"major_category_id":"2","majorCategory1Id":"2","majorCategory2Id":null,"majorCategory3Id":null,"majorCategoryUrl":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/browse\/music","keywords":[],"createFacebookEvent":true,"bio":"<p><em>Interiors <\/em>is Quicksand&rsquo;s best album yet.&nbsp; It sounds like nothing else you are going to hear this year.<\/p>\r\n<p>It arrives deliberately unannounced, two decades after the pioneering post-hardcore quartet&rsquo;s last album. Made completely on the band&rsquo;s own terms, <em>Interiors <\/em>has a power, strength and subtlety that will likely stun you. There are no wasted notes, no flab, and no excess whatsoever. It is absolutely perfect.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This struck a chord, where we felt this is actually something that could represent us <em>now<\/em>,&rdquo; says bassist Sergio Vega. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t sound like a third album a couple of decades later. It&rsquo;s a piece of work that we really, really can <em>back<\/em>.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>That may be an understatement: <em>Interiors <\/em>is breathtaking in its surging, sculptured sonic attack, a welcome reminder that the band&rsquo;s longtime status as musical innovators is not undeserved.<\/p>\r\n<p>To make the record, the band first had to return to the beginning&mdash;to the purity of why Quicksand started making music in the first place. In the process, they made a great record that speaks to their past&mdash;but, more essentially, to their present and future.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;First we went out and made the record we wanted to make, with the person we wanted to make it with,&rdquo; says drummer Alan Cage. &ldquo;Then we went with a finished product and said &lsquo;OK, who&rsquo;s going to put this thing out?&rsquo; Of course we want to share it, have people listen to it, and create their own relationship with it--but at the core, it is our thing. &ldquo;I think we landed in a perfect place to do that with epitaph.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;When we first became a band, that&rsquo;s what we did with making our EP. We put together $1500 and recorded the songs, because no one knew or cared about what we were doing, except for us. We took the same approach with <em>Interiors<\/em>.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>And of course, so much has changed since then.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled to be listening back to a record that we made with our own money, on our own schedule and creative terms,&rdquo; says Quicksand front man\/guitarist Walter Schreifels. &ldquo;While it was definitely important for us to speak to our longtime fans, we thought the best way to do that was to embrace who we are now, to allow our selves to be open to people that have never heard of us. Our tastes and experiences as musicians and as people have grown, and we decided to run with that. As a result, I think &lsquo;Interiors&rsquo; has a wider spectrum on it than our past records.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Interiors <\/em>makes clear via its searing opening sequence of tracks that Quicksand&rsquo;s skills as songsmiths and players have never been sharper.<\/p>\r\n<p>From the pulse-pounding start of the opening track &ldquo;Illuminant,&rdquo; the band immediately draws you in with its unique combination of pounding rhythm and shifting loud\/soft dynamics, heightened by Schreifels&rsquo; deliberately restrained&mdash;but powerful&mdash;vocal.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"To me, &lsquo;Illuminant&rsquo; was the first song that set the bar for the rest of the album. We had compiled various jams and song inspirations that we&rsquo;d recorded at sound checks and rehearsals, but it is a significant step to take song ideas, riffs etc. and commit to the structure that makes it a &lsquo;song.&rsquo; Especially for us. We were searching for the abstract idea of &lsquo;what does a new Quicksand song sound like?&rsquo; Once we put &lsquo;Illuminant&rsquo; together, it happened pretty quickly. I felt confident we could make a great album.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>A similar standout is &ldquo;Cosmonauts,&rdquo; a stylistic leap forward for the band both in terms of its powerfully rhythmic, slow pacing and Schreifels&rsquo; textured and melodic vocal.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;One of the things about Quicksand back in the day that made it hard for me was that most of the vocals were close to the top of my range, it had impact but was exhausting to perform live. As a Quicksand song, &lsquo;Cosmonauts&rsquo; has all the elements that our fans dig, but I gave myself license to sing. Over time I&rsquo;ve discovered that if you have the right emotional pitch--if you understand what you&rsquo;re trying to say, you don't necessarily have to scream it to make a point.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>That point also applies to the album&rsquo;s title track, among the finest the band has ever recorded. &ldquo;Interiors&rdquo; is majestic, glacial, powerful, throbbing&mdash;like no other song you&rsquo;ve ever heard&mdash;pairing a howling, repetitive guitar figure partnered with Schreifels&rsquo; emotional, almost resigned delivery of the lyrics. It is a mind-blower from top to bottom, and its final moments feature a stunning instrumental break ranking among Quicksand&rsquo;s best ever work.<\/p>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s an astounding array of sonic diversity displayed on <em>Interiors <\/em>that will satisfy Quicksand fans both old and new. And that&rsquo;s been done purposely, adds Schreifels, pointing to the significant contributions of producer Will Yip. &ldquo;I worked with Will on another project some years ago--Title Fight&rsquo;s <em>Shed<\/em> album,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We had a blast. And with Will&rsquo;s combination of expertise and taste, I knew that he would gel with the other Quicksand guys.<\/p>\r\n<p>No small matter was the fact that Yip has produced the records of several young, critically admired bands that cite Quicksand as an influence, he adds.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It made sense to thread that with where music is now. While working on this record, Will really joined the band--and every move we made was in service of the song sonically, structurally and overall energy-wise. We were not afraid to diverge from formula moves, and we were also down to embrace aspects of our style that our fans have come to expect--as long as there was a twist.<\/p>\r\n<p>\"For example, &lsquo;Under The Screw&rsquo; I really dig because I wanted something that kind of connected to the Quicksand that people remember,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But in the vocals, I took a more surrealistic approach than I would have in the past--which I think gives license for us to take more unexpected turns as the song progresses.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>There is a sense of growth and maturity on <em>Interiors <\/em>that longtime fans will hear upon first listen. A lot has happened since the early &lsquo;90s, a lot has happened since those days of <em>Manic Compression <\/em>and the very first Warped Tour. And a lot has happened in the lives of the four members of Quicksand.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This record just sounds like who we are,&rdquo; says Schreifels. &ldquo;Lyrically, I wasn&rsquo;t interested in re-creating some ersatz version of the struggles I was having when I was 20 years old, I lived that already. It took me a minute to find the thread but once I had a few songs done, the language and themes of Interiors began to write themselves.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>From start to finish, there is growth, there is strength, and there is power in this music. More power than ever before, and it may surprise you.<\/p>\r\n<p>Translation? Quicksand has made the album of a lifetime. And now the world gets to <em>hear <\/em>it.<\/p>","shortBio":null,"aliases":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/artists\/170\/quicksand-tickets","urlSlug":"quicksand-tickets","externalPartnerID":{},"media":{"103":{"media_id":"3995542","width":860,"height":400,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2018\/03\/quicksand_03-30-18_103_5abe998168ea8.jpg"},"88":{"media_id":"4526883","width":1200,"height":628,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/06\/quicksand_06-10-22_88_62a28bc95da6c.jpg"},"19":{"media_id":"4526885","width":678,"height":399,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/06\/quicksand_06-10-22_19_62a28c8308cc4.jpg"},"5":{"media_id":"4526886","width":318,"height":187,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/06\/quicksand_06-10-22_5_62a28c833f85d.jpg"},"6":{"media_id":"4526887","width":238,"height":140,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/06\/quicksand_06-10-22_6_62a28c8355c0b.jpg"},"9":{"media_id":"4526888","width":134,"height":79,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/06\/quicksand_06-10-22_9_62a28c836c869.jpg"},"20":{"media_id":4526889,"width":564,"height":564,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/06\/quicksand_06-10-22_20_62a28d16c62bc.jpg"},"7":{"media_id":4526890,"width":220,"height":220,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/06\/quicksand_06-10-22_7_62a28d16ef570.jpg"},"24":{"media_id":4526891,"width":322,"height":322,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/06\/quicksand_06-10-22_24_62a28d1710c5c.jpg"}},"city":null,"state":null,"country":"United States","countryCode":"US","tier":null,"eventDisplay":1,"events":[],"fanClubs":[],"links":[{"link_id":"925197","link_title":"Official Website","link_type_id":"8","link_href":"http:\/\/www.quicksandnyc.com\/","link_target":"_none"},{"link_id":"928724","link_title":"Facebook Page","link_type_id":"12","link_href":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/QuicksandNYC","link_target":"_none"},{"link_id":"905856","link_title":"Twitter","link_type_id":"13","link_href":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/QuicksandNYC","link_target":"_none"},{"link_id":"905857","link_title":"Youtube VEVO","link_type_id":"14","link_href":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/QuicksandVEVO?feature=watch","link_target":"_none"},{"link_id":"905858","link_title":"Featured Video","link_type_id":"15","link_href":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/HGPzJs1WK88","link_target":"_none"}]},{"performerId":"208825","active":true,"locale":"en-US","localeAvailable":{"1":"en-US"},"name":"Off With Their Heads","under21":false,"minorCategoryText":"Alternative \/ Punk","minorCategoryId":"10","minorCategory1Id":"10","minorCategory2Text":null,"minorCategory2Id":null,"minorCategory3Text":null,"minorCategory3Id":null,"minorCategoryUrl":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/browse\/music\/alternative-punk","majorCategoryText":"Music","majorCategory2Text":null,"majorCategory3Text":null,"major_category_id":"2","majorCategory1Id":"2","majorCategory2Id":null,"majorCategory3Id":null,"majorCategoryUrl":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/browse\/music","keywords":[],"createFacebookEvent":true,"bio":"<div>Off With Their Heads' new album&nbsp;<em>Be Good<\/em>&nbsp;is available now.&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>&ldquo;All the other records were about moping around and feeling sorry for yourself,&rdquo; says frontman Ryan Young. &ldquo;This one is less about feeling sorry for yourself and more about accepting how goddamn miserable you are.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>Young and the band members&mdash;bassist Robbie Smartwood, guitarist John Polydoros, and new drummer Kyle Manning&mdash;holed up at The Hideaway in Minneapolis with additional recording at Pachyderm Studios, a mid-century mansion where Nirvana recorded In Utero, to make&nbsp;<em>Be Good<\/em>.

The genre-fluid, eclectic rock ensemble has drawn varied comparisons to the dynamic jams of Umphrey's McGee and Widespread Panic, songwriting prowess of John Prine, experimental psychedelia of Pink Floyd, progressive jazz-infused rock of Frank Zappa, and off-color humor of Ween and They Might Be Giants. Including elements of crowd participation, off-the-cuff comedic bits, haphazard choreography, musical improvisation, and surprise musical guests, each Kendall Street Company concert is an experience unlike any other. You'll laugh, you'll cry. Just remember to stay hydrated.<\/div>\r\n<div style=\"box-sizing: border-box; word-break: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: #183247; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; word-break: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: #183247; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">In addition to their reputation as must-see live performers, the Company's prolific immunity to writer's block has led them to release over over 100 original songs between seven studio albums, two live albums, and four EPs in a period of just six years. 2023 will see the release of (at least) an additional two studio records, a handful of singles, and who knows what else! You can also enjoy a massive selection of live shows on nugs.net, which often include unreleased and improvised tracks, as well as covers ranging from the Grateful Dead to DEVO to Alanis Morisette to Soulja Boy.<\/div>\r\n<div style=\"box-sizing: border-box; word-break: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: #183247; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; word-break: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; color: #183247; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Kendall Street Company is: Louis Smith [Rhythm Guitar\/Lead Vox], Brian Roy [Bass], Ryan Wood [Drums], Ben Laderberg [Lead Guitar], and Jake Vanaman [Saxophone\/Keys]. The five met at the University of Virginia, where they graduated between 2015 and 2020. For such a young band, their accomplishments are commendable. They have performed at festivals including Lockn', Summer Camp, High Sierra, Resonance, Floydfest, Some Kind of Jam, and Rooster Walk. Featured guest musicians at their sets have included Keller Williams, Ron Holloway, Andy Frasco, and Andy Hall. The Company has also shared the stage with Goose, Umphrey's McGee, Papadosio, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, Leftover Salmon, the Infamous Stringdusters, Big Something and Melvin Seals &amp; JGB. The outfit draws their name from late-night bonfires at the Kendall Street Beach on the Chesapeake Bay, and the good company who fueled the flames, the jams, and the conversation.<\/div>","shortBio":null,"aliases":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/artists\/1113589\/kendall-street-company-tickets","urlSlug":"kendall-street-company-tickets","externalPartnerID":{},"media":{},"city":null,"state":null,"country":"United

of the most innovative and prestigious bands in modern symphonic metal, heavy icons KAMELOT present their most introspective, uplifting, vital release to date - their first full-length in five years, 2023&rsquo;s aptly titled The Awakening.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Power of One&rdquo; - what does this mean to modern symphonic\/gothic metal masters KAMELOT? Above all else, it means sticking to a singular vision from beginning to end, which is exactly what&rsquo;s allowed the multinational quintet to become the leading force in their field for roughly 25 years.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>On their 13th studio album, The Awakening, the band expressly invites listeners to discover &ldquo;the power of one&rdquo; within themselves as well. Exuding the impassioned songwriting, complex musicianship, and sophisticated production that&rsquo;s always made KAMELOT a remarkable act, the LP offers a more diverse, uplifting, and introspective journey compared to bleaker predecessor The Shadow Theory. As such, The Awakening encourages its audience to, well, awaken not only to the grandeur of its genre(s), but to the greatness of life itself.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Formed by guitarist Thomas Youngblood in 1991, KAMELOT also includes bassist Sean Tibbetts, keyboardist Oliver Palotai, and vocalist Tommy Karevik. In addition, The Awakening is their first original recording with drummer Alex Landenburg, whom Youngblood praises as &ldquo;extremely creative, cool, and positive,&rdquo; adding: &ldquo;The drums on this record are amazing, and he definitely brings invigorating energy and chemistry to what we do.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Given their extensive history and renowned artistry&mdash;spread across two dozen studio LPs and two live records&mdash;it&rsquo;s only right that the group has amassed so many fans and accolades over the last quarter-century.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Having reigned supreme with the release of internationally top-charting melodic metal pinnacles such as The Fourth Legacy (1999), The Black Halo (2005), Silverthorn (2012), Haven (2015, #1 US Hard Rock Albums), and most recently 2018&rsquo;s acclaimed The Shadow Theory (#2 US Hard Music Albums), The Awakening enters the KAMELOT legacy as their most massive and diverse offering yet - mixing symphonic, gothic, melodic, progressive and power metal styles while yielding some of the heaviest tracks in the band&rsquo;s history.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Understandably, The Awakening arrives with vast expectations, yet as always, KAMELOT unquestionably exceeded them. In fact, even the title represents the band&rsquo;s commitment to (and message of) seizing every opportunity and appreciating every moment in a post-pandemic world. &ldquo;Initially, it was about awakening our senses to what was really important because we all kind of got forced to stay home more and be more social with our family and friends. It&rsquo;s about awakening from our slumber and welcoming the new world,&rdquo; Youngblood ponders.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Awakening tackles a wide-array of resonant and pertinent topics that virtually all listeners can relate to. From explorations of societal division (&ldquo;New Babylon&rdquo;) and parent-child relationships (&ldquo;NightSky&rdquo;) to declarations of unrelenting strength (&ldquo;My Pantheon (Forevermore),&rdquo; &ldquo;The Looking Glass,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Great Divide&rdquo;) and hopeful outlooks (&ldquo;Midsummer&rsquo;s Eve,&rdquo; &ldquo;Willow&rdquo;), every track on The Awakening is as deeply contemplative as it is hugely entertaining.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>That blend of freshness and familiarity also extends to the music, with The Awakening cleverly evoking some earlier styles amidst incorporating innovative approaches.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Youngblood aptly explains: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some stuff that harkens back to what made The Fourth Legacy and The Black Halo so special. At the same time, we figured why not have some fun and write some modern metal material as well. Honestly, the record is packed with everything that KAMELOT fans like.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Helping bring the band&rsquo;s vision to life are longtime partner Sascha Paeth&mdash;who&rsquo;s produced every studio LP since The Fourth Legacy&mdash;and returning The Shadow Theory collaborator Jacob Hansen (Volbeat) on mastering and mixing duties.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The quintet aren&rsquo;t the only ones playing on the record, either, as they&rsquo;re once again joined by a few superb guests. In particular, multifaceted Ad Infinitum singer Melissa Bonny elevates &ldquo;New Babylon,&rdquo; just as violinist Florian Janoske and Grammy-nominated cellist Tina Guo beautify &ldquo;Midsummer&rsquo;s Eve.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s also added vocal layers from JUNO Award-winning producer Brian Howes on &ldquo;One More Flag in the Ground,&rdquo; not to mention &ldquo;a whole variety of people in the choir parts, too,&rdquo; Youngblood specifies.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We met Melissa years ago, at first at some KAMELOT shows, and later I saw her doing a KAMELOT cover on YouTube,&rdquo; Youngblood reveals. &ldquo;She absolutely crushes her parts here, as does everyone else. We always look for new talent to feature and\/or ways to cross collaborations off of the bucket list, and I&rsquo;m so happy we were able to do that with The Awakening.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>While the COVID-19 pandemic certainly made it difficult for other groups to produce new work, that wasn&rsquo;t really the case for KAMELOT, because they&rsquo;re used to writing, recording, and refining in separate places.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was definitely way more remote than in the past, but we&rsquo;re spread out all over the world anyway, so it&rsquo;s not like we can drive down the road to hang out. This time, we recorded in five different studios, including ones in Florida, Germany, and Canada. Plus, a lot of the initial songwriting was done at the start of 2020, before COVID, and there&rsquo;s new software now that allowed us to go over the mix with Jacob in real time. I do miss the old ways of getting at least partially together, though, but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll get back to that with the next album,&rdquo; Youngblood reflects.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Awakening could be described as a complex process, but followers both old and new will undoubtedly find it to be the band&rsquo;s finest outing to date. For instance&mdash;and in keeping with tradition&mdash;it&rsquo;s bookended by two gorgeously affective instrumentals (&ldquo;Overture&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ephemera,&rdquo; respectively) that embody KAMELOT&rsquo;s beloved knack for theatrical continuity.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Youngblood expounds: &ldquo;We try to frame records like stories or movies, with an opening soundtrack and closing credits. We still write records for fans who want to listen to a full piece of music from beginning to end, but people who don&rsquo;t want that will still get a whole bunch of great individual songs to hear.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>To his point, the LP houses KAMELOT&rsquo;s most varied, daring, and satisfying array of material in-between, too.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>For example, there&rsquo;s the Middle Eastern-tinged self-empowerment of radio-friendly lead single &ldquo;One More Flag in the Ground,&rdquo; as well as the modernized edge of &ldquo;NightSky,&rdquo; the idyllic nostalgia of &ldquo;Willow,&rdquo; the prog metal splendor of &ldquo;The Looking Glass,&rdquo; and the symphonic pensiveness of &ldquo;Midsummer&rsquo;s Eve.&rdquo; At the same time, pieces such as the darkly thunderous &ldquo;Eventide,&rdquo; the feistily cinematic &ldquo;The Great Divide,&rdquo; the malevolently orchestral &ldquo;New Babylon,&rdquo; and the robustly dynamic &ldquo;My Pantheon (Forevermore)&rdquo; conjure classic KAMELOT, plain and simple.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>On that note, there&rsquo;s even a continuation of an earlier KAMELOT gem via the touchingly dramatic &ldquo;Opus of the Night (Ghost Requiem).&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The title track of 2007&rsquo;s Ghost Opera was about a girl whose dream was to sing in front of the opera, but on the way to her debut, she&rsquo;s assaulted. So, she never makes it there. Now, we&rsquo;re seeing her granddaughter fulfill that dream and find resolution and catharsis,&rdquo; Youngblood describes.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"The music of KAMELOT has always carried the message of hope, light and a feeling of resolution. This story is a prime example of that. &lsquo;Opus of the Night (Ghost Requiem)&rsquo; honors the traditional dark and melodic sound of the band while bringing some new and exciting elements to the table,\" adds vocalist Tommy Karevik.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Naturally, such compelling compositions require equally fascinating visuals, which is where Greek artist Giannis Nakos comes in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our first time working with him,&rdquo; says Youngblood, &ldquo;and he did a fantastic job. The artwork and the booklet and the Earbook are incredible.&rdquo; Indeed, Nakos&rsquo; designs perfectly complement the music they represent.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Fittingly, The Awakening will also see KAMELOT embark on the biggest tour in their history, starting with a European run in the spring of 2023 and then carrying over to North America the fall. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming off of our biggest concert and DVD shoot to date [2020&rsquo;s I Am the Empire &ndash; Live from the 013], but we&rsquo;re certainly not resting on our laurels. We want to get out there and showcase The Awakening for as many people as possible,&rdquo; Youngblood rejoices.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>As they should. From beginning to end, The Awakening finds KAMELOT at their most poised, imaginative, and empathetic, matching heartfelt storytelling and personal convictions with characteristically adventurous yet gratifying instrumentation. In that way, it&rsquo;s an essential reflection on where they&mdash;and us&mdash;have been, as well as a hopeful plea for where we all should be headed.<\/p>","tier":null,"axsTicketedEvent":true,"safetyIcons":[],"safetyModalEnabled":false,"fanSkins":[],"eventRedirect":{"enabled":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/festivals\/525986"},"description":null,"minorCategoryId1":"22","minorCategoryId1Label":"Hard

It&rsquo;s about awakening from our slumber and welcoming the new world,&rdquo; Youngblood ponders.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Awakening tackles a wide-array of resonant and pertinent topics that virtually all listeners can relate to. From explorations of societal division (&ldquo;New Babylon&rdquo;) and parent-child relationships (&ldquo;NightSky&rdquo;) to declarations of unrelenting strength (&ldquo;My Pantheon (Forevermore),&rdquo; &ldquo;The Looking Glass,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Great Divide&rdquo;) and hopeful outlooks (&ldquo;Midsummer&rsquo;s Eve,&rdquo; &ldquo;Willow&rdquo;), every track on The Awakening is as deeply contemplative as it is hugely entertaining.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>That blend of freshness and familiarity also extends to the music, with The Awakening cleverly evoking some earlier styles amidst incorporating innovative approaches.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Youngblood aptly explains: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some stuff that harkens back to what made The Fourth Legacy and The Black Halo so special. At the same time, we figured why not have some fun and write some modern metal material as well. Honestly, the record is packed with everything that KAMELOT fans like.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Helping bring the band&rsquo;s vision to life are longtime partner Sascha Paeth&mdash;who&rsquo;s produced every studio LP since The Fourth Legacy&mdash;and returning The Shadow Theory collaborator Jacob Hansen (Volbeat) on mastering and mixing duties.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The quintet aren&rsquo;t the only ones playing on the record, either, as they&rsquo;re once again joined by a few superb guests. In particular, multifaceted Ad Infinitum singer Melissa Bonny elevates &ldquo;New Babylon,&rdquo; just as violinist Florian Janoske and Grammy-nominated cellist Tina Guo beautify &ldquo;Midsummer&rsquo;s Eve.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s also added vocal layers from JUNO Award-winning producer Brian Howes on &ldquo;One More Flag in the Ground,&rdquo; not to mention &ldquo;a whole variety of people in the choir parts, too,&rdquo; Youngblood specifies.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We met Melissa years ago, at first at some KAMELOT shows, and later I saw her doing a KAMELOT cover on YouTube,&rdquo; Youngblood reveals. &ldquo;She absolutely crushes her parts here, as does everyone else. We always look for new talent to feature and\/or ways to cross collaborations off of the bucket list, and I&rsquo;m so happy we were able to do that with The Awakening.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>While the COVID-19 pandemic certainly made it difficult for other groups to produce new work, that wasn&rsquo;t really the case for KAMELOT, because they&rsquo;re used to writing, recording, and refining in separate places.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was definitely way more remote than in the past, but we&rsquo;re spread out all over the world anyway, so it&rsquo;s not like we can drive down the road to hang out. This time, we recorded in five different studios, including ones in Florida, Germany, and Canada. Plus, a lot of the initial songwriting was done at the start of 2020, before COVID, and there&rsquo;s new software now that allowed us to go over the mix with Jacob in real time. I do miss the old ways of getting at least partially together, though, but I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll get back to that with the next album,&rdquo; Youngblood reflects.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Awakening could be described as a complex process, but followers both old and new will undoubtedly find it to be the band&rsquo;s finest outing to date. For instance&mdash;and in keeping with tradition&mdash;it&rsquo;s bookended by two gorgeously affective instrumentals (&ldquo;Overture&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ephemera,&rdquo; respectively) that embody KAMELOT&rsquo;s beloved knack for theatrical continuity.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Youngblood expounds: &ldquo;We try to frame records like stories or movies, with an opening soundtrack and closing credits. We still write records for fans who want to listen to a full piece of music from beginning to end, but people who don&rsquo;t want that will still get a whole bunch of great individual songs to hear.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>To his point, the LP houses KAMELOT&rsquo;s most varied, daring, and satisfying array of material in-between, too.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>For example, there&rsquo;s the Middle Eastern-tinged self-empowerment of radio-friendly lead single &ldquo;One More Flag in the Ground,&rdquo; as well as the modernized edge of &ldquo;NightSky,&rdquo; the idyllic nostalgia of &ldquo;Willow,&rdquo; the prog metal splendor of &ldquo;The Looking Glass,&rdquo; and the symphonic pensiveness of &ldquo;Midsummer&rsquo;s Eve.&rdquo; At the same time, pieces such as the darkly thunderous &ldquo;Eventide,&rdquo; the feistily cinematic &ldquo;The Great Divide,&rdquo; the malevolently orchestral &ldquo;New Babylon,&rdquo; and the robustly dynamic &ldquo;My Pantheon (Forevermore)&rdquo; conjure classic KAMELOT, plain and simple.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>On that note, there&rsquo;s even a continuation of an earlier KAMELOT gem via the touchingly dramatic &ldquo;Opus of the Night (Ghost Requiem).&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The title track of 2007&rsquo;s Ghost Opera was about a girl whose dream was to sing in front of the opera, but on the way to her debut, she&rsquo;s assaulted. So, she never makes it there. Now, we&rsquo;re seeing her granddaughter fulfill that dream and find resolution and catharsis,&rdquo; Youngblood describes.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>\"The music of KAMELOT has always carried the message of hope, light and a feeling of resolution. This story is a prime example of that. &lsquo;Opus of the Night (Ghost Requiem)&rsquo; honors the traditional dark and melodic sound of the band while bringing some new and exciting elements to the table,\" adds vocalist Tommy Karevik.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Naturally, such compelling compositions require equally fascinating visuals, which is where Greek artist Giannis Nakos comes in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our first time working with him,&rdquo; says Youngblood, &ldquo;and he did a fantastic job. The artwork and the booklet and the Earbook are incredible.&rdquo; Indeed, Nakos&rsquo; designs perfectly complement the music they represent.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Fittingly, The Awakening will also see KAMELOT embark on the biggest tour in their history, starting with a European run in the spring of 2023 and then carrying over to North America the fall. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming off of our biggest concert and DVD shoot to date [2020&rsquo;s I Am the Empire &ndash; Live from the 013], but we&rsquo;re certainly not resting on our laurels. We want to get out there and showcase The Awakening for as many people as possible,&rdquo; Youngblood rejoices.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>As they should. From beginning to end, The Awakening finds KAMELOT at their most poised, imaginative, and empathetic, matching heartfelt storytelling and personal convictions with characteristically adventurous yet gratifying instrumentation. In that way, it&rsquo;s an essential reflection on where they&mdash;and us&mdash;have been, as well as a hopeful plea for where we all should be headed.<\/p>","shortBio":null,"aliases":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/artists\/104396\/kamelot-tickets","urlSlug":"kamelot-tickets","externalPartnerID":{},"media":{"19":{"media_id":4693784,"width":678,"height":399,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/04\/kamelot_04-19-23_19_644023b07f47d.jpg"},"5":{"media_id":4693785,"width":318,"height":187,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/04\/kamelot_04-19-23_5_644023b0de815.jpg"},"6":{"media_id":4693786,"width":238,"height":140,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/04\/kamelot_04-19-23_6_644023b116b51.jpg"},"9":{"media_id":4693787,"width":134,"height":79,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/04\/kamelot_04-19-23_9_644023b13a5ac.jpg"},"20":{"media_id":4693788,"width":564,"height":564,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/04\/kamelot_04-19-23_20_644023b156509.jpg"},"7":{"media_id":4693789,"width":220,"height":220,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/04\/kamelot_04-19-23_7_644023b175477.jpg"},"24":{"media_id":4693790,"width":322,"height":322,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/04\/kamelot_04-19-23_24_644023b19a5ea.jpg"},"88":{"media_id":4693791,"width":1200,"height":628,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/04\/kamelot_04-19-23_88_644023b1bd267.jpg"}},"city":null,"state":null,"country":"United States","countryCode":"US","tier":null,"eventDisplay":1,"events":[],"fanClubs":[],"links":[{"link_id":"933378","link_title":"Myspace","link_type_id":"8","link_href":"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/kamelot","link_target":"_blank"},{"link_id":"897024","link_title":"Facebook Page","link_type_id":"12","link_href":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kamelotofficial","link_target":"_none"},{"link_id":"928379","link_title":"Youtube VEVO","link_type_id":"14","link_href":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/kamtv","link_target":"_blank"},{"link_id":"961391","link_title":"Twitter","link_type_id":"13","link_href":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KamelotOfficial","link_target":"_none"},{"link_id":"979777","link_title":"Featured Video","link_type_id":"15","link_href":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MsGDBwMVBas","link_target":"_blank"}]}],"supportingActs":[{"performerId":"207155","active":true,"locale":"en-US","localeAvailable":{"1":"en-US"},"name":"Hammerfall","under21":false,"minorCategoryText":"Hard Rock \/ Metal","minorCategoryId":"22","minorCategory1Id":"22","minorCategory2Text":null,"minorCategory2Id":null,"minorCategory3Text":null,"minorCategory3Id":null,"minorCategoryUrl":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/browse\/music\/hard-rock-metal","majorCategoryText":"Music","majorCategory2Text":null,"majorCategory3Text":null,"major_category_id":"2","majorCategory1Id":"2","majorCategory2Id":null,"majorCategory3Id":null,"majorCategoryUrl":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/browse\/music","keywords":[],"createFacebookEvent":true,"bio":"<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>\r\n <w:WordDocument>\r\n  <w:View>Normal<\/w:View>\r\n  <w:Zoom>0<\/w:Zoom>\r\n  <w:PunctuationKerning\/>\r\n  <w:ValidateAgainstSchemas\/>\r\n  <w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false<\/w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>\r\n  <w:IgnoreMixedContent>false<\/w:IgnoreMixedContent>\r\n  <w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false<\/w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>\r\n  <w:Compatibility>\r\n   <w:BreakWrappedTables\/>\r\n   <w:SnapToGridInCell\/>\r\n   <w:WrapTextWithPunct\/>\r\n   <w:UseAsianBreakRules\/>\r\n   <w:DontGrowAutofit\/>\r\n  <\/w:Compatibility>\r\n  <w:BrowserLevel>MicrosoftInternetExplorer4<\/w:BrowserLevel>\r\n <\/w:WordDocument>\r\n<\/xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>\r\n <w:LatentStyles DefLockedState=\"false\" LatentStyleCount=\"156\">\r\n <\/w:LatentStyles>\r\n<\/xml><![endif]--><!--[if !mso]><object\r\n classid=\"clsid:38481807-CA0E-42D2-BF39-B33AF135CC4D\" id=ieooui><\/object>\r\n<style>\r\nst1\\:*{behavior:url(#ieooui) }\r\n<\/style>\r\n<![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 10]>\r\n<style>\r\n \/* Style Definitions *\/\r\n table.MsoNormalTable\r\n\t{mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\";\r\n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0;\r\n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0;\r\n\tmso-style-noshow:yes;\r\n\tmso-style-parent:\"\";\r\n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\r\n\tmso-para-margin:0in;\r\n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt;\r\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\r\n\tfont-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tmso-ansi-language:#0400;\r\n\tmso-fareast-language:#0400;\r\n\tmso-bidi-language:#0400;}\r\n<\/style>\r\n<![endif]-->\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Formed in Goteborg, Sweden, in 1993 by guitarist Oscar Dronjak. Early line-ups included members from In Flames and Dark Tranquillity, most notably Jesper Stromblad, who continued to write songs together with Oscar and singer Joacim Cans despite leaving before the first album was released. \"Glory To The Brave\" (1997) and \"Legacy Of Kings\" (1998) cemented the band as the pioneers of modern Eighties heavy metal.<br \/> <br \/> Often credited with bringing back the melodies and honesty in music, the world-wide crusade continued with \"Renegade\" (2000), an album that generated a breakthrough for HammerFall and metal music in general in the mainstream media in Sweden.<br \/> <br \/> The line-up was now complete with drummer Anders Johansson, formerly of Rising Force fame, Stefan Elmgren on guitar and Magnus Rosen on bass guitar. The latter two joined HF before the release of the inaugural record, with Stefan even being a session player on \"Glory To The Brave\".<br \/> <br \/> \"Crimson Thunder\" (2002) was next, followed by a live album and DVD - \"One Crimson Night\" (2003) - recorded in their home town in front of a capacity crowd. The fifth album, aptly titled \"Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken\" (2005) further planted the name HammerFall in the minds of households in Sweden, as well as metal fans all over the world. The band's fourth world tour on as many albums was an even bigger success than before, headlining the U.S. for the first time (after supporting Death and Dio in 1998 and 2002 respectively).<br \/> <br \/> Two sportsrelated videos were recorded in 2006, a remake of \"Hearts On Fire\" for the Swedish Olympic Women's Curling Team and a brand new song specifically written for Kajsa Bergqvist and a couple of other Swedish track &amp; field superstars, culminating in a performance at the opening ceremony at the European Athletics Championships in August, bringing HammerFall into the home of 250 million people around the world. Threshold (2006) saw the light of day at the end of the year, and virtually the entire 2007 was spent on the road promoting it.<br \/> <br \/> Magnus Rosen left the band in March. Without skipping a beat, original basist Fredrik Larsson was brought back into the fold, elevating the musical side with his steady brilliance. Celebrating its ten year anniversary as a record-releasing artist, HammerFall released \"Steel Meets Steel - Ten Years of Glory\" (2007). The album features two brand new tracks, a re-recording of an old classic plus some bonus material for the true fans.<br \/> <br \/> Surprising to all, Stefan got a job as an airline pilot in the spring of 2008, and after careful consideration decided to pursue that dream instead. Pontus Norgren of The Poodles fame replaced Stefan and made his on stage debut with the band at the Heavy MTL Festival in Montreal, Canada.<br \/> <br \/> Sometimes hailed as the leaders of the new heavy metal movement, \"the new and improved\" HF is currently working on a new studio album, scheduled for release on February 20th, 2009.<\/p>","shortBio":null,"aliases":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/artists\/207155\/hammerfall-tickets","urlSlug":"hammerfall-tickets","externalPartnerID":{},"media":{"24":{"media_id":"105519","width":322,"height":322,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/aeglive\/000\/040\/Event-25291-28-11132009-0.jpg"}},"city":null,"state":null,"country":null,"countryCode":null,"tier":null,"eventDisplay":1,"events":[],"fanClubs":[],"links":[{"link_id":1047946,"link_title":"Featured

The combination of his searching growl, world-weary rhymes, and impeccable beat selection has catapulted him to the top of Detroit&rsquo;s ever-competitive rap scene. The rising star currently has more than 57 million US streams, and his YouTube channel has a combined 42 million views. He sounds like a rapper who has been doing this his entire life. But to hear Skilla explain it, rap almost accidentally happened to him. &ldquo;Where I&rsquo;m from, everyone raps, but since everyone does it, it&rsquo;s not that special,&rdquo; he says. The teenage Skilla had no reason to believe his freestyles were any better than those of his peers. He was simply killing time until his next football practice or shootaround practice for basketball. But as he began to book studio time and release projects like 2019&rsquo;s Push That Shit Out Skilla and 2021&rsquo;s Standing on Business, it became abundantly clear that no one could rap the way Skilla Baby does.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Take the first track from his celebrated new EP, We Eat the Most, out last year via Geffen Records. On &ldquo;Tay B Style,&rdquo; an homage to local legend Tay B, Skilla spits over a menacing piano line and banging drums, in line with fellow Detroit wordsmiths like Bandgang Lonnie Bands and Cash Kidd. Skilla sets the scene with an unflinching eye and a willingness to spell out life in the streets with the seriousness such a world deserves: &ldquo;Firebomb the weed house, can&rsquo;t get no more weed out\/ I&rsquo;ll knock your teeth out your mouth and make you bleed out\/ When I see a n***a I don&rsquo;t like, shit get violent\/ &rsquo;Cause I grew up fightin&rsquo;, hearin' police sir\u0435ns.&rdquo; Immediately, listeners are fully immersed in Skilla Baby&rsquo;s Detroit.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>When listening to We Eat The Most, it&rsquo;s rather shocking to learn that Skilla Baby is introverted by nature. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually very shy,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;I really keep to myself as a person, but with music, it works in a different way. The more success I get, the more I&rsquo;m willing to open up.&rdquo; Perhaps because Skilla has skyrocketed to fame in his hometown he never really had a chance to keep to himself. Or maybe he&rsquo;s grown more willing to share his story as people have grown more eager to hear it. Regardless, rap fans in Motor City and across the country are fortunate that he&rsquo;s more comfortable than ever about putting his life on tape. &ldquo;I was shy when it came to talking and meeting new people, but I wasn&rsquo;t shy when it came to my talent. I always knew I could do whatever I wanted. That was instilled in me by my father,&rdquo; Skilla explains.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>When listening to We Eat The Most, it&rsquo;s rather shocking to learn that Skilla Baby is introverted by nature. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m actually very shy,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;I really keep to myself as a person, but with music, it works in a different way.

I always knew I could do whatever I wanted. That was instilled in me by my father,&rdquo; Skilla explains.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>The other figures who have played a huge role in Skilla Baby&rsquo;s development are his manager, East Side Juan, and his mentor, Detroit MC Sada Baby. With his crew, he&rsquo;s found a familial camaraderie that keeps him levelheaded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all team players. When Sada goes crazy, we all support him and Juan focuses on him,&rdquo; Skilla explains. When Skilla is gearing up for a big run, the energy focuses toward him. It&rsquo;s a remarkably democratic process that insists stars&nbsp;check their egos at the door: &ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re so family-oriented, it was easy to come together and deal with some success.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Learning how to deal with that success can often be a massive hurdle in rap, but Skilla Baby is uniquely equipped to outwit the trappings of superstardom. &ldquo;My dad put me in sports growing up so I could have that discipline and that sense of team,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t really the kid that could go mess around and be doing stuff. I feel like that helped me get to where I am today.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Since dropping &ldquo;We Eat The Most&rdquo; Skilla has released a video for Icky Vicky which hit 1 million views in 1 week, and now stands at 2.5 million views. He&rsquo;s also did a tour of the south performing at Morehouse College, went viral for Duck Your Taco shoutout from G. Herbo, Lil Baby brought Skilla out during Superbowl to perform his record &ldquo;Tay B Style,&rdquo; and he popped up in LA to join Shordie Shordie&rsquo;s Rolling Loud Set. Most recently he dropped his first single OK BET on 4\/7, and released a joint project &ldquo;Controversy&rdquo; with Tee Grizzley on 4.28 ahead of WE EAT THE MOST Deluxe out in June. Recently Skilla&rsquo;s had two major collab singles go viral &ldquo;Gorgeous&rdquo; with Tee Grizzely ft City Girls and &ldquo;MAMA&rdquo; with Rob49 and Tay B which has hit 3+ Million views and is now top 40 nationwide at Urban Radio. In the fall he launched his first inaugural Skilla Day with performances from G Herbo, Luh Tyler, Tee Grizzley, Lakeyah and more, the event will also be hosted by Dreamdoll, ahead of releasing. The rising star&rsquo;s YouTube channel has a combined 111M views across all videos, 1.5 Million monthly listening on Spotify, and currently has over 180M US streams. Recently he was given a shoutout in Jack Harlow&rsquo;s latest single and was featured on Ok Bet pt 2 with Luh Tyler.

formed in early 2003, with Beau Burchell and Justin Shekoski on guitar and Anthony Green on vocals. Within a few months, bassist Chris Sorenson and drummer Alex Rodriguez were added to the line up. In February 2004, Anthony decided to leave the band due to personal reasons. The band started working with Cove Reber on vocals as of June 2004. Southern California quintet Saosin are one of the fastest-growing headliners in rock - earning mainstage slots on the Vans Warped Tour, selling out clubs in a flash, going out with heavyweights like AFI, Avenged Sevenfold, My Chemical Romance and Taking Back Sunday and garnering an ocean of fans who've downloaded their songs from MySpace over five million times - all before they've released a full-length album.\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\nIt's been three years since word of the band's full-length debut first surfaced, and in that time a lot has changed within the music scene from which they originally emerged and within the band itself.\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\nBut the band's sound and its ambition grew tremendously during the recording of their 12-song debut, an album that exceeds even the wildest of expectations. From the dueling guitar crunch of opener \"It's Far Better to Learn\" to the nosebleed anthemic heights of lead single \"Voices,\" the livewire maelstrom of \"Follow and Feel\" and epic heartstring-puller \"You're Not Alone,\" Saosin have created the kind of debut album that announces something indisputably new under rock's sun.\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\nThe initial stages of the band's debut date back to late 2003 when founding guitarists Burchell and Shekoski and original frontman Anthony Green began playing out, recorded a quick EP, Translating the Name, and embarked on a U.S. tour during which time Green exited the band. To the group's surprise Translating the Name garnered the band a massive fanbase both online and at their live shows, which grew organically, and quickly.\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\nIn the winter of 2005 the revamped Saosin lineup with Sorenson, Rodriguez and new frontman Reber signed to Capitol, released a self-titled EP of demos and live tracks, and began pre-production on their long-awaited full-length debut. As the band recorded various versions of their new songs - both at their home studios and on a mobile recording unit that they set up on their tour bus - the burden of heavy expectations eventually gave way to genuine excitement.\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\nIn turn, the album that Saosin began recording with producer Howard Benson (My Chemical Romance, Head Automatica) this past January - nearly a full year after they began properly demoing its songs - would live up to the band's great expectations, and then some. More importantly, though, it proves that in a world of overnight success at least one group is devoted enough to write songs that are built to last.","tier":null,"axsTicketedEvent":true,"safetyIcons":[],"safetyModalEnabled":false,"fanSkins":[],"eventRedirect":{"enabled":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/festivals\/550767"},"description":null,"minorCategoryId1":"10","minorCategoryId1Label":"Alternative

years into making their fourth album, Frog in Boiling Water, the four members of DIIV needed to talk\u2014not later, but now. <br><br>\n\nThe extended process had been uncertain and sometimes grueling, not only pushing them to up their musicianship but also taxing most every resource and bond they had ever cultivated. During the prior decade, DIIV had helped revitalize dream-pop and shoegaze alike, culminating in 2019\u2019s unapologetic genre showcase, Deceiver. But with it, DIIV were now out of contract, proverbial free agents who didn\u2019t owe anything to anyone but themselves\u2014that is, to make a record that challenged them, that pushed their sound beyond any previous parameters. <br><br>\n\nBut after all that collective toil, their relationships with one another were fraying badly inside that singular alchemical state of being a band, where dynamics of family, friendship, and finances become entangled in a Gordian knot. There were suspicions and resentments, bruised egos and anxious questions, all fingerprints left by a quest that demanded DIIV grow both together and apart. So on June 1, 2023, just before they began to mix four years of effort, DIIV\u2014Andrew Bailey, Colin Caulfield, Ben Newman, and Zachary Cole Smith\u2014gathered in Echo Park Lake, the scene of so many halcyon hangs in their early days, under vaguely gray skies to air accumulated grievances. They dropped the shields of professionalism that had let them work amid the rancor and allowed themselves to get mad and bummed, real and vulnerable. Really, it could have broken DIIV before Frog in Boiling Water was finished. <br><br>\n\nThis fireside, however tense, worked: DIIV eventually finished Frog in Boiling Water. It is a gorgeous and haunted record, as DIIV gaze into our collective oblivion and try to articulate a trace of hope inside that enveloping gloom. Balancing rhythms first built from breakbeats and inspired by post-industrial power with guitars and vocals that often billow like diaphanous drapery, Frog in Boiling Water is mighty but breezy, greyscale but opalescent. \u201cReflected,\u201d for instance, surges through softness, reckoning with the lies we tell ourselves to survive while wondering if they still serve us. \u201cBrown Paper Bag\u201d funnels dejection and angst into an exquisite intersection of dream-pop and post-rock, a wispy tune stretching from a steely foundation. Though DIIV helped to foster a shoegaze scene that has since swept up many imaginations, they rose above it despite nearly falling apart. On these 10 songs, they brood beautifully inside music that frets about the present and future\u2014but at least acknowledges it can still exist. <br><br>\n\nThe instant DIIV finished Deceiver in early 2019, they were ready to run it back, to make another live-in-the-room record as soon as possible. The sessions had been brief and efficient, the four members in newfound lockstep. Could they amplify that feeling? They never got the chance. With the world upended, every member began working on their own pieces, individual tastes accreting into a mountain of material so large they began to grade each item, A to F. They daydreamed about what the pieces might eventually make, sometimes discarding the notion of a \u201crock record\u201d for one made with computers and samples or sometimes pondering something as heavy and blissful as Justin K. Broadrick\u2019s Jesu. There were samples, tape machines, breakbeats: Everything seemed possible, open, new. <br><br>\n\nDIIV had once been hamstrung by obdurate headlines, gossip about Smith\u2019s personal problems often overshadowing the work of the cohesive, smart rock quartet they had gradually become. What\u2019s more, Smith co-founded United Musicians and Allied Workers, an organization devoted to wresting power away from an entertainment oligarchy. Principles from both scenarios\u2014no hierarchy and equal participation, no overriding frontman but instead four people interacting in full\u2014had become central to DIIV\u2019s approach, prompting them to move as a democracy more than ever before. <br><br>\n\nThis equitable approach created inevitable strain, especially when DIIV finally rendezvoused in early 2022 to figure out how all their enthusiasms could cohere. They decamped to a rented home in the Mojave, guitars, recording gear, and a clutch of books about humanity\u2019s failures, psychological warfare, and Zen poetry in tow. They worked 13 hours a day for 10 days straight, so taxed as they tried to circle a sound that Caulfield earned himself a case of nicotine poisoning. They hoped to finish the bulk of the record there, to capture a room sound that felt ineffable. But stress mounted as they struggled to solidify what their fourth album could be, to funnel their individual passions into a collective whole that also said something about our precarious moment. They headed home without a record. <br><br>\n\nAdding another strong perspective did not alleviate this tension, but it did help break the stalemate. For DIIV, working with producer Chris Coady\u2014whose records with the likes of Beach House and Blonde Redhead were mutual lodestars\u2014was fittingly aspirational. They felt they would need to rise to his level. In September 2022, as they began religiously tracking six days a week at his home studio for the next nine months, he became the de facto fifth member, joining existential debates about DIIV\u2019s direction and how to get there. He switched sides as he saw fit. <br><br>\n\nEven when the conflicts felt insurmountable, with five personalities vying for a say in DIIV\u2019s future, they all showed up and tried, anyway. They all worked to get better, too. Sometimes that meant Newman was up at 7 a.m. to practice breakbeats created by some of the best drummers in the world. Sometimes that meant Coady setting up a tape machine in his backyard, Bailey filling it with warped tape samples that DIIV could then weave into the worlds they were trying to build. And Smith became a father in November 2022, prompting a three-month pause as he wrestled with a central, difficult question at home: How could he lyrically conjure a dystopia with a newborn in the house, or pair the new hope he had with an honest assessment of the world he knew? It all felt like that midair moment during a complicated skateboard trick, wondering if you have what it takes to land the thing. <br><br>\n\nAgain, they did: These songs mine a new lyrical and musical depth, those two halves mirroring one another inside a reflective and immersive whole. Opener \u201cIn Amber,\u201d for instance, offers an internal existential debate about slipping out of this world, of shaking off its turmoil. The downtrodden guitars of Smith and Bailey perfectly paint this feeling for the first half, but they lift together toward the end, an act of resistance against abject despair. <br><br>\n\nOr there\u2019s the way that Newman and Caulfield conjure a very warped and muted funk inside the rhythm section of \u201cSoul-Net,\u201d a prime canvas for Smith\u2019s character study about those who have found meaning for a vacuous life through online conspiracy theories. Here is our suffering, sold and weaponized against us inside endless rabbit holes. They ride this haze into panoramic finale \u201cFender on the Freeway,\u201d a chiming drift that steadily tightens and coils like a ripple of lean muscle. \u201cYou can\u2019t unring a bell,\u201d Smith sings, voice soft-lidded but suppliant. \u201cWe live in heaven, and we live in hell.\u201d That is the contrast that every song on Frog in Boiling Water frames so well\u2014the darkness of these days, an appreciation of existence itself. <br><br>\n\nOn that afternoon in Echo Park, the future seemed very much in doubt for DIIV. They were exhausted, broke, and bruised, having spent four years in a four-way trust fall without knowing how it might end. Voicing concerns doesn\u2019t always fix them, of course, but could they understand one another enough to carry on, together? They did, finally starting the process of finishing Frog in Boiling Water in the days that followed. Still, everyone in DIIV will tell you now that those conflicts\u2014the natural result of four people whose lives have become so intertwined, trying to make art that speaks to humanity\u2019s current place on a complicated precipice\u2014still exist. To some extent, they remain an engine inside of their art. <br><br>\n\nThat is, in many ways, the essence of Frog in Boiling Water, a record about doing your best to carry on in spite of oft-grim prospects. While making Frog in Boiling Water, DIIV taxed their bonds and brotherhood, pushing themselves to the brink as a band, as buds. The result, however, is a mesmeric testament to enduring, to envisioning anything else on the other side while you remain here, in the slowly heating water of right now.","tier":null,"axsTicketedEvent":true,"safetyIcons":[],"safetyModalEnabled":false,"fanSkins":[],"eventRedirect":{"enabled":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/festivals\/532227"},"description":null,"minorCategoryId1":"21","minorCategoryId1Label":"Indie

On their third full-length, Natural Part, the Boston-based three-piece revels in the act of grasping at something that can&rsquo;t be held, smudging the lines between rich details, hazy memories, vivid moments, and intangible feelings to create their most captivating record to date.<br \/> <br \/>Horse Jumper of Love&ndash;guitarist\/vocalist Dimitri Giannopoulos, bassist John Margaris, and drummer Jamie Vadala-Doran&ndash;have steadily evolved since their formation in 2014, honing a mix of sprawling slowcore and raw indie rock across their 2016 self-titled debut and 2019&rsquo;s So Divine. Now, Natural Part feels like the band&rsquo;s biggest step forward yet. The group teamed once again with engineer Bradford Krieger and convened at his Rhode Island studio, Big Nice, to record. &ldquo;I definitely don&rsquo;t write the same way I did for the other records anymore,&rdquo; Giannopoulos explains. &ldquo;I never want to force anything or try to stick to a formula, and for this record I really felt like I could do whatever I wanted. I feel like I know myself a little more, like I&rsquo;m a little more tapped into who I am and the songs feel more personal because of it.&rdquo;<br \/> <br \/>Sonically, Natural Part feels even more expansive than anything Horse Jumper of Love have done before, which is no small feat for a band whose music has often hinged on billowing guitars and roomy drums. Mixed by Danny Reisch (Sun June, Shearwater, White Denim), the album features a noticeable leap in fidelity, allowing the detailed songwriting to shine through without losing the tactile edges that imbue Horse Jumper of Love&rsquo;s music with so much personality. Opener &ldquo;Snakeskin&rdquo; gently welcomes the listener with an enveloping atmosphere, before a sharply angled guitar riff in the towering second track &ldquo;Ding Dong Ditch&rdquo; fractures the aura. Familiar influences like Duster and David Berman can still be heard throughout, but new elements like cello&mdash;performed by Emily Dix Thomas and inspired by both Nirvana&rsquo;s unplugged album and listening to Oasis&rsquo; &ldquo;Wonderwall&rdquo; in preparation for a Halloween cover set)&mdash;add different textures to the band&rsquo;s reverberating sound. On &ldquo;Chariots,&rdquo; the new instrumentation blends effortlessly with Vadala-Doran and Margaris&rsquo; taut but roaming rhythm section, and adds an otherworldly mood to Giannopoulos&rsquo; lyrics.<br \/> <br \/>A sense of mystery and the inevitability of change permeates much of Natural Part, with Giannapoulos often capturing snapshots that take note of a flickering feeling in the mundane, and then letting his imagination expand it into something profound. The title track encapsulates this approach as well as some of the recurring sentiments of the record: &ldquo;I was thinking about the natural distancing that can happen between people,&rdquo; Giannapoulos says. &ldquo;They can just go their separate ways or grow apart, or it can even be people passing away. But that thought also started with me literally combing my hair,&rdquo; he adds with a laugh. &ldquo;The line between figurative and not gets pretty blurry. Sometimes weird shit happens but there&rsquo;s some meaning there. Something will just stand out, you get immersed in it, and a song sort of flows out. It all feels like a collage of a certain time in my life.&rdquo;<br \/> <br \/>On songs like the poppy &ldquo;I Poured Sugar In Your Shoes,&rdquo; the hypnotic &ldquo;Under The House (Skunks),&rdquo; or the off-kilter &ldquo;Sitting On The Porch At Night,&rdquo; Giannopoulos&rsquo; molds the very specific experiences noted in the titles into meditations on life&rsquo;s intricacies. Late in the album, the sub-two-minute standouts &ldquo;I Put A Crown On You&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mask&rdquo; highlight Horse Jumper of Love&rsquo;s ability to economically communicate larger ideas; the former is a shining acoustic missive on appreciation blurring dependency, while the latter is a slowly unfurling plume of guitars that contemplates the physical and invisible barriers between us. &ldquo;I was thinking about someone driving their car, wearing a mask&ndash;literal or not literal&ndash;and having that layer in front of their face,&rdquo; Giannopoulos explains. &ldquo;Then the windshield is another layer, and it&rsquo;s a foggy night, so that&rsquo;s another layer. You&rsquo;re passing by them and there&rsquo;s just all of these real and not real things between you and another person.&rdquo;<br \/> <br \/>It&rsquo;s those kinds of details that makes Natural Part such a compelling listen. It&rsquo;s an album planted firmly in small moments that feel big: the unexpected flashes that somehow feel authentic and esoteric all at once, and cut through our busy lives to ground us in something that seems meaningful&mdash;even if we can&rsquo;t fully articulate why. &ldquo;I love when those moments happen and it inspires something,&rdquo; Giannopoulos reflects. &ldquo;It makes me feel connected to the world. When something sparks my interest like that, it just feels like this is what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;<\/p>","shortBio":null,"aliases":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/artists\/1102778\/horse-jumper-of-love-tickets","urlSlug":"horse-jumper-of-love-tickets","externalPartnerID":{},"media":{"19":{"media_id":"4512302","width":678,"height":399,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/05\/horse-jumper-of-love_05-17-22_19_6283fd113c061.jpg"},"5":{"media_id":"4512303","width":318,"height":187,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/05\/horse-jumper-of-love_05-17-22_5_6283fd11649c7.jpg"},"6":{"media_id":"4512304","width":238,"height":140,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/05\/horse-jumper-of-love_05-17-22_6_6283fd1186d60.jpg"},"9":{"media_id":"4512305","width":134,"height":79,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/05\/horse-jumper-of-love_05-17-22_9_6283fd11a0d1f.jpg"},"20":{"media_id":"4512306","width":564,"height":564,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/05\/horse-jumper-of-love_05-17-22_20_6283fd11bfda5.jpg"},"7":{"media_id":"4512307","width":220,"height":220,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/05\/horse-jumper-of-love_05-17-22_7_6283fd11e73f7.jpg"},"24":{"media_id":"4512308","width":322,"height":322,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/05\/horse-jumper-of-love_05-17-22_24_6283fd1220d77.jpg"},"88":{"media_id":"4512317","width":1200,"height":628,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2022\/05\/horse-jumper-of-love_05-17-22_88_6283fd74a450d.jpg"}},"city":null,"state":null,"country":"United

as<em> <\/em>a<em> <\/em>&ldquo;must-see live performer&rdquo; by Rolling Stone<em>, <\/em>and a &ldquo;force to be reckoned with&rdquo; by CMT, Charley Crockett crafts his singular &ldquo;Gulf &amp; Western&rdquo; sound &mdash; described as &ldquo;very 21<sup>st<\/sup> century and very vintage&rdquo; by NPR Music &mdash; by synthesizing country, blues, soul, Cajun, R&amp;B and other pieces of American Roots music. And when his voice comes out of your speakers, there is no confusing him for any other artist. As the Wall Street Journal writes, &ldquo;Mr. Crockett&rsquo;s unique vocal style is one third Ernest Tubb honky-tonk with clipped-word diction, one third Bill Withers low-key, soulful crooning, and one third jazzy French Quarter second-line swagger.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>With his latest album <em>$10 Cowboy<\/em>, Crockett didn&rsquo;t set out to make a themed record. He had released a concept album in 2022, the critically acclaimed <em>The<\/em> <em>Man From Waco<\/em>, propelling Crockett to new heights and establishing him as one of the leaders of a sparkling revival of traditional country and folk music.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>For the follow up album, Crockett wrote freely, over a two-month period, as he wound his way across the United States on the back of a tour bus. The resulting songs&mdash;raw, personal, vivid portraits of a country in transition&mdash;ended up being connected after all.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;This material is written at truck stops, it&rsquo;s written at casinos, it&rsquo;s written in the alleys behind the venues, it&rsquo;s written in my truck parked up on South Congress in Austin,&rdquo; explains Crockett. &ldquo;A ramblin&rsquo; man like me, a genuine transient, is in a pretty damn good position to have something to say about America.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The album begins with the title track, a personal song that also offers a provocative idea about America. &ldquo;A $10 Cowboy is a country singer who made himself on a street corner in America,&rdquo; Crockett says. &ldquo;But the cowboy way, the cowboy mindset, that applies to anyone who doesn&rsquo;t feel free, who feels fenced in and bound to something.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>As the album unfolds, you begin to understand that a $10 Cowboy is anyone who has hustled to get by, who didn&rsquo;t fit in, who has slept on other people&rsquo;s couches, or the street, who has fallen down, gotten up, and ventured from home chasing a paying gig, or a new start.<\/p>\r\n<p>The album was recorded at Arlyn Studios in Austin, produced by Crockett and his long-time collaborator Billy Horton. It was recorded live to tape, with anywhere from 6-12 musicians on each track, giving the songs the feel of a live performance. It&rsquo;s a sound Crockett has been after for years. &ldquo;The reason I cut it on tape is, when you get the right folks in the room, great players rise to the occasion. When that red light is on and the tape is rolling, you get the magic of a performance.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Crockett released his last full-length album <em>The Man From Waco<\/em> - which Rolling Stone named the #2 best Country album of the year - in 2022, and the momentum he built continued into 2023. Crockett made his NPR Tiny Desk debut, was a guest on The Daily Show, and appeared on the June 2023 cover of Texas Monthly. Crockett performed at both nights of Willie Nelson&rsquo;s 90<sup>th<\/sup> birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl in April 2023, and made his Bonnaroo debut last summer.&nbsp;Crockett also released <em>The Man From Waco Redux<\/em>, a companion to <em>The Man From Waco <\/em>featuring alternate versions of five songs, and <em>Live from the Ryman<\/em>, which documented Crockett&rsquo;s sold out November 2022 debut at the Mother Church of Country

Her forthcoming second album, Fatigue, demands introspection from ready ears with an array of keyboards, synths, and hauntingly delicate vocals that create a genre entirely her own. Cheek has dipped her toes in every corner of the arts, through her work at some of the most prestigious art institutions in NYC and collaborations with the likes of Naama Tsabar, Kevin Beasley, Justin Allen, and others in contemporary arts.<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>How do we think through, express for, attest to, commit within and embody a substantive change for ourselves? How do we enact change in the company of others? What does it mean to internally engage with an abolition politic? These questions compose and propel the sonic energy of Fatigue. Over the course of 15 tracks, L&rsquo;Rain continues her careful plotting of where we travel when cruising along the side alleys and major roads of an emotional city. Fatigue progresses the psychic collage assembled from her self-titled debut. Fatigue, while still cycling the wheel of grief, veers into the self-reckoning of holding emotional multiplicities that do not and cannot remain static. Cheek knows how we feel, and who we feel, expanding ever outward.<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>In the closing moments of the opening track, &ldquo;Fly, Die&rdquo;, we are asked, &lsquo;What have you<br \/>done to change?&rdquo; This question is both invitation and invocation. Change and changing is not something done alone; it is a group process. L&rsquo;Rain is clear in her desire for the collective to reflect and feel, admit and deny, balance and discard, consider and implement with her.<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>With a release date in 2021, the timing of Fatigue is not coincidental. Collectively, we are navigating the immense and looming figure of unremitting fatigue brought on by the ongoing pandemic, mass death, continued violence against Black people at the hands of the state, and the mountain range systemic problems obstructing safety and security for the people that need it most. This quick succession of events wears our resilience to weariness. To question the nature of change with the awareness of weariness is to question the nature of exhaust: what are we putting out?<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>Fatigue puts out slippery sonics that Cheek describes as &ldquo;approaching songness.&rdquo; This &ldquo;approaching songness&rdquo; highlights L&rsquo;Rain&rsquo;s commitment to the experimental value of process as her practice. Heavily blending genres (thus making new unnameable space for herself) including but not limited to gospel, jazz, and neo-soul, Fatigue fractures and mends our expectations of what musicians, especially Black women musicians, are categorized to do versus what they need to do (and actually do).<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>In many ways, Fatigue is a sonic meditation on finding balance through the obliteration<br \/>of binary logic. Refusing the finitude of either\/or, L&rsquo;Rain readily embraces the flexibility both\/and provides. &ldquo;This album is an exploration of the simultaneity of human emotions&hellip;the audacity of joy in the wake of grief, disappointment in the face of accomplishment. The pervasiveness of this layering of emotions can be surprising, empowering, and discouraging; these overlaps happen every single moment, all the time,&rdquo; L&rsquo;Rain expresses. &ldquo;I might be trying to be heard more on this record. You can hear more of the words, my vocals are louder.&rdquo; This sentiment is most clearly, though subtly, expressed in the titles of the tracks. The titles can be read as a poem of 30 words and 15 lines, potentially divided into 3 stanzas. The presentation of poetic intervention brilliantly subverts our expectations of what lyrics do, where they present, the summarization of ideas, where and how marginalized people can be read or misread. &ldquo;Black people, who, in the face of violence and discrimination, are often given little time to process.&rdquo; The poetics of Fatigue gains even more radical momentum when we make clear

Aquarium<br \/>Things Change<\/p>\r\n<p>In the lush tobacco fields of North Carolina where BJ Barham was raised, people work hard. Families stay nearby, toiling and growing together. BJ loves those farms and his tiny Reidsville hometown, but he had to run off and start American Aquarium, a band now beloved by thousands.<\/p>\r\n<p>BJ couldn&rsquo;t stay. But he couldn&rsquo;t really leave, either: he&rsquo;s still singing about the lessons, stories, and lives that define rural America&ndash;&ndash;and him.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I moved to the big city to go to college and fell in love with music,&rdquo; BJ says. &ldquo;But half the songs on our record are about small towns&ndash;&ndash;little pieces of my childhood. I&rsquo;ve had moments where it turns out a piece of broken English my father repeated twice a week is the most accurate way to say something. So I put it in a song.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>American Aquarium&rsquo;s seventh studio album Things Change offers the band&rsquo;s finest collection of folk-infused Southern rock-and-roll to date. Stacked with BJ&rsquo;s signature storytelling&ndash;&ndash;always deeply personal but also instantly relatable&ndash;&ndash;the record questions and curses current events, shares one man&rsquo;s intimate evolution, and leaves listeners with a priceless gift: hope.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;In my early 20s, I was not as hopeful,&rdquo; BJ says. &ldquo;Now, as I&rsquo;m getting ready to become a father, I think I have to be hopeful&ndash;&ndash;especially with the situation our country is in now. For her sake, I have to be positive.&rdquo; He pauses. &ldquo;Her&rdquo; is his daughter, due in the spring of 2018. BJ adds, &ldquo;Being self-aware has always been a blessing and a curse. But that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s always made my songwriting relatable to people. I don&rsquo;t hold back. I&rsquo;m almost too honest.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>BJ&rsquo;s candor has fueled American Aquarium&rsquo;s runaway appeal, visible most clearly in consistently sold-out shows across the country and throughout Europe &ndash; between 200 and 250 dates a year. Much has changed for the band and BJ since their acclaimed last effort, Wolves. In 2017, every American Aquarium member save BJ quit the group. American Aquarium has featured about 30 players since BJ founded the outfit in 2006, and while each member has left indelible marks, the band has always been anchored by the literary songs and sometimes roaring, sometimes whispering, drawl of BJ Barham. BJ&rsquo;s personal life also underwent seismic shifts: He got sober. He got married. Soon, he&rsquo;ll be a dad.<\/p>\r\n<p>Featuring a new band lineup that includes Shane Boeker on lead guitar, drummer Joey Bybee, bassist Ben Hussey, and Adam Kurtz on pedal steel and electric guitar, as well as a reinvigorated frontman in BJ, Things Change is American Aquarium&rsquo;s first release on a label after selling thousands of records on their own. &ldquo;As an artist, your goal is for the newest thing you do to be better than the last. You&rsquo;re slowly whittling away the bullshit to try and get to the truth,&rdquo; BJ says. &ldquo;With this album, I learned how to cut some of that fat so that it&rsquo;s just truth. It&rsquo;s our best record.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Recorded at 3CG Records in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Things Change was produced by Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter John Fulbright and features cameos from Americana standouts including John Moreland and Jamie Lin Wilson. Brazen album opener &ldquo;The World is on Fire&rdquo; is a richly layered rock-and-roll anthem that documents BJ and his wife&rsquo;s stunned reaction to the last presidential election. Emotional and conversational, the song taps into widespread feelings of confusion and fear: &ldquo;She said, &lsquo;What are we going to do? What&rsquo;s this world coming to?&rsquo; \/ For the first time in my whole life, I stood there speechless.&rdquo; But what begins as despair builds into defiant faith, as BJ growls a call to action to cap off one of his favorite songs he&rsquo;s ever written. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m complaining about the state of things, and then the third verse almost serves as a challenge to myself: hey, you&rsquo;re in charge of another human being. You can create change,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\r\n<p>Driving rock-and-roller &ldquo;Crooked + Straight&rdquo; explores the small-town consequences of questioning religion, and the tightness of family in the face of one member&rsquo;s rejection. His father&rsquo;s advice anchors the song. &ldquo;I come from a blue-collar family. I&rsquo;m the only one who didn&rsquo;t go into farming. I learned if you want something, you have to go out and take it. You can&rsquo;t expect anything from anybody,&rdquo; BJ says. &ldquo;You can only go out there and work harder. My dad always said you can outwork anybody else.&rdquo; Love for hard work and the people who carry it out appears repeatedly throughout Things Change. Guitar-heavy &ldquo;Tough Folks&rdquo; is a snarling ode to those with dirt under their fingernails, while bass- and pedal-steel-infused &ldquo;Work Conquers All&rdquo; spins a tale in praise and pursuit of Oklahoma&rsquo;s state motto.<\/p>\r\n<p>The album&rsquo;s love songs are the kind of achingly beautiful that only comes with maturity and a willingness to expose one&rsquo;s own flaws. Haunting &ldquo;Shadows of You&rdquo; recalls a lover&rsquo;s flight as the protagonist longs for what he let get away. Gorgeous &ldquo;Till the Final Curtain Falls&rdquo; celebrates loyalty and pledges endless devotion. The moving title track takes an often doleful topic&ndash;&ndash;people&rsquo;s tendency to change&ndash;&ndash;and turns it on its head, tracing BJ&rsquo;s personal growth and recognizing his now-wife&rsquo;s steadfast love.<\/p>\r\n<p>BJ&rsquo;s other two favorite tracks are album standouts. Moving &ldquo;When We Were Younger Men&rdquo; addresses the break-up of American Aquarium head on. As BJ professes love for his former bandmates over stripped down acoustic guitar, his voice is honeyed and deep. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an open letter to five guys who I spent eight years of my life with seeing the entire world,&rdquo; BJ says. &ldquo;I think anyone who has ever had to walk away from a friendship or has had somebody walk away from them will relate to the song.&rdquo; Stunner &ldquo;One Day at a Time&rdquo; is self-perceptive and vulnerable, detailing BJ&rsquo;s battles with himself. Even within his career full of well-written gems, the song is a towering accomplishment.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;At the end of the day, if you&rsquo;re not writing songs to affect other people&rsquo;s lives, you&rsquo;re in it for the wrong reasons,&rdquo; BJ says, reflecting on the new album, where he&rsquo;s been, and where American Aquarium is headed. &ldquo;Money may come and go. You may never get fame. But if you sit down and write songs to affect people, you can do it your whole life and be happy.&rdquo;<\/p>","tier":null,"axsTicketedEvent":true,"safetyIcons":[],"safetyModalEnabled":false,"fanSkins":[],"eventRedirect":{"enabled":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/festivals\/552134"},"description":null,"minorCategoryId1":"15","minorCategoryId1Label":"Country","minorCategoryId2":null,"minorCategoryId2Label":null,"minorCategoryId3":null,"minorCategoryId3Label":null,"majorCategoryId1":"2","majorCategoryId1Label":"Music","majorCategoryId2":null,"majorCategoryId2Label":null,"majorCategoryId3":null,"majorCategoryId3Label":null,"venue":{"venueId":"125119","active":true,"distanceMiles":null,"distanceKilometers":null,"locale":"en-US","localeAvailable":{"1":"en-US"},"title":"The

its latest album, &ldquo;Fortune Favors The Bold,&rdquo; Russell County, Virginia-based 49 Winchester is ready and roaring to break onto the national scene with its unique brand of tear-in-your-beer alt-country, sticky barroom floor rock-n-roll, and high-octane Appalachian folk.<br \/>&ldquo;As we&rsquo;ve aged and matured, our sound has gone from a softer place to this grittier, edgier tone that we have now,&rdquo; says lead singer\/guitarist Isaac Gibson. &ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re trending more towards being a rock band instead of a country band. But, at the same time, I don&rsquo;t think anybody&rsquo;s ever known quite what to call it.&rdquo;<br \/>Although it&rsquo;s 49 Winchester&rsquo;s fourth studio album, &ldquo;Fortune Favors The Bold&rdquo; marks its debut for Nashville&rsquo;s New West Records &mdash; one of the premier labels for Americana, indie and rock acts on the cutting edge of sound, scope and spectacle.<br \/>Formed eight years ago on Winchester Street in the small mountain town of Castlewood, Virginia (population: 2,045), the band started as a rag tag bunch of neighborhood teenagers who just wanted to get together for the sake of playing together.<br \/><br \/>Aside from Gibson, there&rsquo;s also his childhood friend, bassist Chase Chafin, alongside other Castlewood cronies &mdash; guitarist Bus Shelton, and Noah Patrick on pedal steel.<br \/>&ldquo;From day one, it&rsquo;s always been a band and it will always be about being a band. This is everything, everything we love about music &mdash; we&rsquo;re going for broke with this thing,&rdquo; says Gibson. &ldquo;And that gives us a unique perspective because it&rsquo;s still the same guys. It&rsquo;s still all of us from Castlewood traveling around, playing music and making this band a reality &mdash; this is a story of growth.&rdquo;<br \/>And it&rsquo;s that sense of growth &mdash; more so, a sense of self &mdash; at the core of &ldquo;Fortune Favors The Bold.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not only a record that showcases the current state of 49 Winchester, it&rsquo;s a melodic stake in the ground of how this group is constantly evolving and taking shape, sonically and lyrically.<br \/>Reflecting on his early days as a jack-of-all-trades stone mason in Castlewood, where it was about trying to make ends meet in an effort to keep 49 Winchester rolling along, Gibson can&rsquo;t help but be grateful for a well-earned notion at the core of the band&rsquo;s ethos &mdash; anything worthwhile in life is built brick-by-brick.<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;Everything has to be built. And very few people are going to achieve success overnight,&rdquo; says Gibson. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be people you see succeed in front of you. Maybe you don&rsquo;t think they deserve it as much as you, haven&rsquo;t worked as hard as you, haven&rsquo;t done it as long as you. But, none of that matters &mdash; they ain&rsquo;t you. They&rsquo;re not living your life. They&rsquo;re not part of your experience.&rdquo;<br \/>At its essence, &ldquo;Fortune Favors The Bold&rdquo; is about going against all odds to bring your art into fruition and into the world. It&rsquo;s about leaving your hometown and heading for the unknown horizon. And it&rsquo;s about proving those wrong who snickered and waited for the day you&rsquo;d give up somewhere down the line, only to circle back home with your tail between your legs.<br \/>But, it&rsquo;s also about looking into the rearview mirror with a genuine appreciation for where you came from and what you&rsquo;re made of, those hardscrabble, salt-of-the-earth traits in your blood and character that define what it actually takes to climb that damn mountain of dreams &mdash; come hell or high water.<br \/><br

October, while standing onstage in front of 20,000 people at London&rsquo;s 02 Arena, it<\/p>\r\n<p>dawned on 49 Winchester lead singer\/guitarist Isaac Gibson that on the same day,<\/p>\r\n<p>exactly 10 years ago, he formed the rapidly rising alt-country band.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been nothing in my life that&rsquo;s ever lasted a decade,&rdquo; Gibson says. &ldquo;We had just<\/p>\r\n<p>gotten out of high school when we played our first show &mdash; 10 years later we&rsquo;re opening<\/p>\r\n<p>for Luke Combs at the O2 Arena.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>On the heels of Combs&rsquo; European tour, 49 Winchester has been selling out storied<\/p>\r\n<p>venues across America, including a wildly successful Canadian run alongside Corb Lund.<\/p>\r\n<p>And, in celebration of these recent milestones, comes the release of 49 Winchester&rsquo;s<\/p>\r\n<p>latest album, Leavin&rsquo; This Holler.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We were on a slow simmer for a lot of years before things really started to pick up with<\/p>\r\n<p>our last record Fortune Favors the Bold,&rdquo; Gibson says. &ldquo;And this new album is going to<\/p>\r\n<p>do it even bigger.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Leavin&rsquo; This Holler is 49 Winchester&rsquo;s fifth studio album, and second collaborative work<\/p>\r\n<p>with Virginia-native producer Stewart Myers. In addition, the project also features the<\/p>\r\n<p>Czech National Symphony Orchestra, singer-songwriter Maggie Antone on backing<\/p>\r\n<p>vocals, fiddler Philip Bowen, and guitarist Cole Chafin. Chafin is not only the guitar tech<\/p>\r\n<p>for 49 Winchester, he&rsquo;s also the younger brother of the band&rsquo;s founding member and<\/p>\r\n<p>bassist, Chase Chafin.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We take influence from a lot of different avenues,&rdquo; Gibson says. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t shy away<\/p>\r\n<p>from any of the music we like.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Being in front of massive audiences, all eager to witness 49 Winchester&rsquo;s raucous, live<\/p>\r\n<p>wire shows, Gibson felt it was a moment where he could honestly reflect on the<\/p>\r\n<p>hard-earned, unrelenting determination and grit within the band that&rsquo;s brought them to<\/p>\r\n<p>this current juncture of increasing notoriety.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a testament to the uncommon fact that we&rsquo;re musicians from a very specific place in<\/p>\r\n<p>the world,&rdquo; Gibson says. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a testament to viewing each other more as family than<\/p>\r\n<p>as friends.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Hailing from Castlewood, Virginia (population: 2.045) in the desolate backwoods of<\/p>\r\n<p>Southern Appalachia &mdash; a place where opportunity seldom knocks &mdash; 49 Winchester<\/p>\r\n<p>came to fruition when Gibson, his childhood best friend, Chafin, and his hometown<\/p>\r\n<p>crony, guitarist Bus Shelton, decided to step off the front porch (on Winchester Street)<\/p>\r\n<p>and take their music to whatever stage would have &rsquo;em.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always been a family affair,&rdquo; Gibson says. &ldquo;When you can look at it that way, as<\/p>\r\n<p>lifelong friends and not business associates or hired guns, you can look at it through a<\/p>\r\n<p>different lens, which just lends itself to longevity.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Since its formation, 49 Winchester has fiercely retained this inner resolve to transcend<\/p>\r\n<p>one&rsquo;s lot in life with a reckless abandon that&rsquo;s led to widespread acclaim and fandom in<\/p>\r\n<p>the country, Americana and rock realms.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re happy to be doing what we&rsquo;re doing and never could have imagined doing it on<\/p>\r\n<p>this scale,&rdquo; Gibson says. &ldquo;Everyday we&rsquo;re out there is a blessing for us.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Captured in a handful studios around the country whenever there was a rare moment<\/p>\r\n<p>between relentless touring schedules &mdash; including recording stints at White Star Sound<\/p>\r\n<p>(Louisa, Virginia), Pet Moose (Richmond, Virginia) and Echo Mountain (Asheville,<\/p>\r\n<p>North Carolina), as well as Nashville&rsquo;s Blackbird and Front Stage &mdash; Leavin&rsquo; This Holler<\/p>\r\n<p>is that signature 49 Winchester sound of rollicking country and searing rock music, but<\/p>\r\n<p>with a matured approach this go-round.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all grown a lot in our personal lives since Fortune Favors the Bold,&rdquo; Gibson says.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Several of us have started families, and that&rsquo;s kind of played into the lyrical themes &mdash;<\/p>\r\n<p>things are a little different with this record.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Beyond its upbeat country tempos (&ldquo;Hillbilly Happy&rdquo;) and sorrowful ballads (&ldquo;Tulsa&rdquo;),<\/p>\r\n<p>whirlwind guitar riffs (&ldquo;Make It Count&rdquo;) and rumbling vocals (&ldquo;Traveling Band&rdquo;),<\/p>\r\n<p>Leavin&rsquo; This Holler offers up a more focused sense of self &mdash; this new, bountiful level of<\/p>\r\n<p>intent and purpose.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Each album captures a kind of different season in my life,&rdquo; Gibson says. &ldquo;In terms of<\/p>\r\n<p>what I&rsquo;m dealing with, what lessons I&rsquo;m learning, what lessons I&rsquo;m failing to learn<\/p>\r\n<p>sometimes.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Both &ldquo;Fast Asleep&rdquo; and &ldquo;Anchor&rdquo; incorporate the Czech National Symphony Orchestra,<\/p>\r\n<p>with the stirring melodies showcasing Gibson&rsquo;s voice erupting into the ether of an<\/p>\r\n<p>unknown tomorrow.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We love the string arrangements from those great country acts of the 1960s, 70s and<\/p>\r\n<p>80s,&rdquo; Gibson says. &ldquo;We wanted to explore every possible sound we could on this record.<\/p>\r\n<p>No stone left unturned sonically &mdash; we got it exactly where we wanted it.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Now with a decade under its belt, 49 Winchester is also going through this full circle of<\/p>\r\n<p>emotions and sentiments as of late. Still calling the rural countryside of Castlewood,<\/p>\r\n<p>Virginia, home, Gibson shakes his head in appreciation and gratitude for the simple<\/p>\r\n<p>things in life, which, as you get older, become the most important.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no place like home &mdash; it&rsquo;s a constant source of inspiration,&rdquo; Gibson says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be<\/p>\r\n<p>riding down some backcountry road and there&rsquo;s just something about that movement,<\/p>\r\n<p>that hum of the motor, and the thoughts running through your mind that spark a song.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>With Leavin&rsquo; This Holler hitting the streets, 49 Winchester is gearing up for more<\/p>\r\n<p>worldwide touring featuring several arena gigs with Tyler Childers and their debut at<\/p>\r\n<p>Bonnaroo.<\/p>\r\n<p>And, in a highly-anticipated appearance, 49 Winchester will also be headlining the<\/p>\r\n<p>famed Bristol Rhythm &amp; Roots Reunion &mdash; a homecoming festival

Beaches are doing everything their way. After more than a decade together as a band, sisters Jordan Miller (lead vocals, bass) and Kylie Miller (guitar), plus closest friends Leandra Earl (guitar and keys) and Eliza Enman-McDaniel (drums), are entering a new era. On the new album Blame My Ex, the 2x Juno Award-winning Toronto band channels heartbreak into self-discovery through 10 exuberant songs that revel in pain and redemption.

starts at ground zero. By wiping the slate clean and turning the page to the next chapter, Sleeping With Sirens re-center, recalibrate, and realign on their fifth full-length and first album for Sumerian Records, <em>How It Feels to Be Lost<\/em>. The gold-certified quintet&mdash;Kellin Quinn [vocals, keyboards], Jack Fowler [lead guitar], Nick Martin [rhythm guitar], Justin Hills [bass], and Gabe Barham [drums]&mdash;amplify the impact of their unpredictable fretwork, velvet vocal acrobatics, and hypnotically heavy alternative transmissions without compromise.<\/p>\r\n<p>In essence, the band strips itself to the core and uncovers what it sought all along&hellip;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We needed to get back into a room and not care about the outcome,&rdquo; exclaims Kellin. &ldquo;We needed to sit down and write something from our hearts we really love and believe in without regard for opinion. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what we did. We didn&rsquo;t care about the result. We wrote one song, liked it, and moved on. Everything finally fell into place.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The time turned out to be right for them to do so.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since emerging in 2010, Sleeping With Sirens have tested the boundaries of rock by walking a tightrope between pop, punk, metal, hardcore, electronic, acoustic, and even a little R&amp;B. This high-wire balancing act attracted a faithful fan base known as <em>&ldquo;Strays<\/em>,<em>&rdquo; <\/em>generated global album sales in excess of 1.5 million, ignited over <em>half-a-billion<\/em> streams, and achieved a trio of gold-selling singles: &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m James Dean, You&rsquo;re Audrey Hepburn,&rdquo; &ldquo;If You Can&rsquo;t Hang,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Scene Two-Roger Rabbit.&rdquo; They launched two albums&mdash;<em>Feel<\/em> and <em>Madness<\/em>&mdash;into the Top 15 of the <em>Billboard<\/em> Top 200. Additionally, they collaborated with MGK on &ldquo;Alone&rdquo; and Pierce the Veil on the gold-certified &ldquo;King For A Day.&rdquo; Beyond selling out shows worldwide and receiving acclaim from <em>The New York Times<\/em>, <em>Alternative Press<\/em> crowned them &ldquo;Artist of the Year&rdquo; at the <em>Alternative Press <\/em>Music Awards, proclaimed &ldquo;Kick Me&rdquo; the 2015 &ldquo;Song of the Year&rdquo;, and featured them as cover stars a whopping seven times.<\/p>\r\n<p>However, everything came to a head during 2017. In the midst of the tour cycle for <em>Gossip<\/em>, Kellin found himself at rock bottom under a haze of depression and alcoholism.<\/p>\r\n<p>Reaching a fork in the road, the future of the band hung in the balance.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I let everything go,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t being the leader I had always been. For the last few years, I was struggling with alcoholism, depression, and anxiety. I didn&rsquo;t know how to turn it around or what to do. Being on the road and touring as much as we did for <em>Gossip<\/em> was really hard on me. I didn&rsquo;t know if I even had it in me to write another record or get on stage and perform. Something just happened one day. I woke up, called Jack, and said, <em>&lsquo;Hey, I want to stop drinking. I want to go into a room and write the best record we&rsquo;ve ever written&rsquo;<\/em>. Both of those things happened within a week.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>With Kellin free from alcohol as of December 2018, he and Jack holed up at MDDN studio in Los Angeles and got to work. This time around, they welcomed longtime friends Zakk Cervini [blink-182] and Matt Good [Asking Alexandria] behind the board as producers. Jack cooked up <em>&ldquo;dark music&rdquo;<\/em> that immediately resonated with the frontman.<\/p>\r\n<p>The whole process <em>&ldquo;felt organic<\/em>,<em>&rdquo;<\/em> as he recalls. <em>&ldquo;The music reflected exactly where I was at<\/em>.<em>&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>As a result, the first single and opener &ldquo;Leave It All Behind&rdquo; exudes an undeniable sense of urgency. A buoyant riff seesaws between electronic echoes before converging on a vocal crescendo topped off by a hard-hitting scream and distorted crash.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, you get those thoughts,&rdquo; he sighs. &ldquo;You wonder, <em>&lsquo;What would happen if I wasn&rsquo;t here?&rsquo;<\/em> I put it into perspective. There are people who listen to my band. There&rsquo;s my family who rely on, love, and me. I realize it&rsquo;s important to stick around, because we can figure it out together. This is also a reminder for the youth to keep fighting.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The follow-up &ldquo;Agree to Disagree&rdquo; tempers a snaky bass line and a rush of vocals with a bold falsetto-punctuated declaration, <em>&ldquo;I like the nighttime, better.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We can sit around and argue all day long, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter who&rsquo;s right or wrong,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;We need to realize if we can&rsquo;t agree, let&rsquo;s find a way to coexist. We have to be open to understanding others, even if we&rsquo;re aren&rsquo;t one-hundred percent on the same page.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the equally anthemic and addictive &ldquo;Medicine&rdquo; confronts Kellin&rsquo;s demons head on as it details <em>&ldquo;being up late at night drinking<\/em>.<em>&rdquo;<\/em> The finale &ldquo;Dying To Believe&rdquo; extracts comfort from darkness beneath cover of strings and guitars with a<em> &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;<\/em> for the fans and reminder <em>&ldquo;to see the best in yourselves<\/em>.<em>&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>In many ways, the title, <em>How It Feels To Be Lost<\/em>, hints at actualization as much as it does potential.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It felt like we finally found what we were looking for with this record,&rdquo; Kellin smiles. &ldquo;The lyrics, the emotion, the musicianship, and the production are all there. It&rsquo;s the best we could do. It&rsquo;s going to be exciting to get on stage and perform these songs. We finally found ourselves.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>In finding themselves, Sleeping With Sirens emerge with their most dynamic and definitive body of work to date.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Certain records have saved our lives,&rdquo; Kellin leaves off. &ldquo;They became staples that I put on.

By wiping the slate clean and turning the page to the next chapter, Sleeping With Sirens re-center, recalibrate, and realign on their fifth full-length and first album for Sumerian Records, <em>How It Feels to Be Lost<\/em>. The gold-certified quintet&mdash;Kellin Quinn [vocals, keyboards], Jack Fowler [lead guitar], Nick Martin [rhythm guitar], Justin Hills [bass], and Gabe Barham [drums]&mdash;amplify the impact of their unpredictable fretwork, velvet vocal acrobatics, and hypnotically heavy alternative transmissions without compromise.<\/p>\r\n<p>In essence, the band strips itself to the core and uncovers what it sought all along&hellip;<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We needed to get back into a room and not care about the outcome,&rdquo; exclaims Kellin. &ldquo;We needed to sit down and write something from our hearts we really love and believe in without regard for opinion. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what we did. We didn&rsquo;t care about the result. We wrote one song, liked it, and moved on. Everything finally fell into place.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The time turned out to be right for them to do so.<\/p>\r\n<p>Since emerging in 2010, Sleeping With Sirens have tested the boundaries of rock by walking a tightrope between pop, punk, metal, hardcore, electronic, acoustic, and even a little R&amp;B. This high-wire balancing act attracted a faithful fan base known as <em>&ldquo;Strays<\/em>,<em>&rdquo; <\/em>generated global album sales in excess of 1.5 million, ignited over <em>half-a-billion<\/em> streams, and achieved a trio of gold-selling singles: &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m James Dean, You&rsquo;re Audrey Hepburn,&rdquo; &ldquo;If You Can&rsquo;t Hang,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Scene Two-Roger Rabbit.&rdquo; They launched two albums&mdash;<em>Feel<\/em> and <em>Madness<\/em>&mdash;into the Top 15 of the <em>Billboard<\/em> Top 200. Additionally, they collaborated with MGK on &ldquo;Alone&rdquo; and Pierce the Veil on the gold-certified &ldquo;King For A Day.&rdquo; Beyond selling out shows worldwide and receiving acclaim from <em>The New York Times<\/em>, <em>Alternative Press<\/em> crowned them &ldquo;Artist of the Year&rdquo; at the <em>Alternative Press <\/em>Music Awards, proclaimed &ldquo;Kick Me&rdquo; the 2015 &ldquo;Song of the Year&rdquo;, and featured them as cover stars a whopping seven times.<\/p>\r\n<p>However, everything came to a head during 2017. In the midst of the tour cycle for <em>Gossip<\/em>, Kellin found himself at rock bottom under a haze of depression and alcoholism.<\/p>\r\n<p>Reaching a fork in the road, the future of the band hung in the balance.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I let everything go,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t being the leader I had always been. For the last few years, I was struggling with alcoholism, depression, and anxiety. I didn&rsquo;t know how to turn it around or what to do. Being on the road and touring as much as we did for <em>Gossip<\/em> was really hard on me. I didn&rsquo;t know if I even had it in me to write another record or get on stage and perform. Something just happened one day. I woke up, called Jack, and said, <em>&lsquo;Hey, I want to stop drinking. I want to go into a room and write the best record we&rsquo;ve ever written&rsquo;<\/em>. Both of those things happened within a week.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>With Kellin free from alcohol as of December 2018, he and Jack holed up at MDDN studio in Los Angeles and got to work. This time around, they welcomed longtime friends Zakk Cervini [blink-182] and Matt Good [Asking Alexandria] behind the board as producers. Jack cooked up <em>&ldquo;dark music&rdquo;<\/em> that immediately resonated with the frontman.<\/p>\r\n<p>The whole process <em>&ldquo;felt organic<\/em>,<em>&rdquo;<\/em> as he recalls. <em>&ldquo;The music reflected exactly where I was at<\/em>.<em>&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>As a result, the first single and opener &ldquo;Leave It All Behind&rdquo; exudes an undeniable sense of urgency. A buoyant riff seesaws between electronic echoes before converging on a vocal crescendo topped off by a hard-hitting scream and distorted crash.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, you get those thoughts,&rdquo; he sighs. &ldquo;You wonder, <em>&lsquo;What would happen if I wasn&rsquo;t here?&rsquo;<\/em> I put it into perspective. There are people who listen to my band. There&rsquo;s my family who rely on, love, and me. I realize it&rsquo;s important to stick around, because we can figure it out together. This is also a reminder for the youth to keep fighting.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The follow-up &ldquo;Agree to Disagree&rdquo; tempers a snaky bass line and a rush of vocals with a bold falsetto-punctuated declaration, <em>&ldquo;I like the nighttime, better.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We can sit around and argue all day long, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter who&rsquo;s right or wrong,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;We need to realize if we can&rsquo;t agree, let&rsquo;s find a way to coexist. We have to be open to understanding others, even if we&rsquo;re aren&rsquo;t one-hundred percent on the same page.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the equally anthemic and addictive &ldquo;Medicine&rdquo; confronts Kellin&rsquo;s demons head on as it details <em>&ldquo;being up late at night drinking<\/em>.<em>&rdquo;<\/em> The finale &ldquo;Dying To Believe&rdquo; extracts comfort from darkness beneath cover of strings and guitars with a<em> &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;<\/em> for the fans and reminder <em>&ldquo;to see the best in yourselves<\/em>.<em>&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>In many ways, the title, <em>How It Feels To Be Lost<\/em>, hints at actualization as much as it does potential.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;It felt like we finally found what we were looking for with this record,&rdquo; Kellin smiles. &ldquo;The lyrics, the emotion, the musicianship, and the production are all there. It&rsquo;s the best we could do. It&rsquo;s going to be exciting to get on stage and perform these songs. We finally found ourselves.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>In finding themselves, Sleeping With Sirens emerge with their most dynamic and definitive body of work to date.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Certain records have saved our lives,&rdquo; Kellin leaves off. &ldquo;They became staples that I put on. They got me through hard times in my life if I needed to scream or sing my heart out or just feel thrashing guitars and loud music. This album brings all of those sides together. I want this to be our anthem for new fans. To the diehards, we want this to do justice for you.

But singer-guitarist Art Alexakis isn&rsquo;t about to start phoning it in now.<\/p>\r\n<p>Although the band hasn&rsquo;t released a new studio album since 2015&rsquo;s triumphant Black Is The New Black, Everclear continues to tour actively, in conjunction with a series of past-release anniversary dates and the annual Summerland Tour, which Alexakis created and has been running since 2012, featuring a rotating cast of &rsquo;90s alt rock favorites. And while it&rsquo;s a virtual surety that no Everclear gig is complete without a rendition of &ldquo;Santa Monica&rdquo; and &ldquo;Father of Mine,&rdquo; lately the band has found that exploring the full range of past material&mdash;especially the &ldquo;deep cuts&rdquo;&mdash;not only gives fans a rare treat, it also injects new life into the band&rsquo;s live dynamic.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;By mixing it up and digging into the catalogue, it still makes it fun and relevant for us, and I think for the fans as well,&rdquo; says Alexakis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still important to play the hits, but by playing those other songs as well, it makes it all seem more vibrant and real. Even though I recorded some of those songs 20 years ago, I haven&rsquo;t played them in a long time, so it&rsquo;s like reinventing the wheel. I&rsquo;m having more fun now than I have in years. I think all of us are.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Formed by Alexakis in 1991 in Portland, Oregon, Everclear has enjoyed a lengthy career spanning 11 studio releases, numerous videos, thousands of shows and accolades that include a 1998 Grammy nomination. Like a true survivor, Alexakis has soldiered on through multiple lineup changes over the years: During the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; era, the band also included Craig Montoya on Bass and Greg Eklund on drums; the current touring lineup features longtime members Dave French (guitar) and Freddy Herrera (bass), as well as drummer Brian Nolan (also with American Hi-Fi), who has performed with Everclear on multiple past tours.<\/p>\r\n<p>This incarnation of the band will hit the road for the 2018 Summerland Tour. As in prior years, Everclear will headline the latest installment of the festival, this time supported by Marcy Playground and Local H, and also featuring a special DJ set Alexakis will contribute, which honors the &rsquo;90s in a refreshingly old-school way.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Summerland Tours are all unique; they all have a different kind of feel to them,&rdquo; says Alexakis. &ldquo;I think this year will be really cool, because it&rsquo;s usually guitar-based, but Marcy Playground is more acoustic-based, yet they still rock in their own way. Local H is just two guys, meanwhile, and they&rsquo;re great, too. So, it&rsquo;s just a different look at &rsquo;90s alternative this year&hellip;different facets of what it&rsquo;s about. With Everclear, we&rsquo;re going to play the hits we always play, but we&rsquo;re also going to mix it up. Every night will be a little different; there&rsquo;ll be a few surprises every show.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>For Alexakis and Co., it&rsquo;s a continuation of a hectic couple of years. Everclear spent May and June of 2017 touring in honor of the 20th anniversary of So Much For The Afterglow, the band&rsquo;s massively successful sophomore major-label release. The 40-date run was an incredibly emotional and personally satisfying experience for Alexakis, who was able to perform obscure cuts from that time period for the first time in many years. Connecting with fans in that setting also reinforced the lasting impression the album has made.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;The tour was phenomenal. It left me and the band stunned at how important that record was to so many people, and to be a part of that, both then and now,&rdquo; says Alexakis. &ldquo;The legacy of it is still vibrant for so many people. It was great just watching people react when we were playing not just the hits, but deeper songs on that record. I always liked the deeper songs&mdash;they were usually my favorite songs&mdash;and when the band would play those, it would be really exciting and important for me. That was fun, seeing that reaction, and just talking to people after the show.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>Prior to that, Everclear experienced a career resurgence thanks to 2015&rsquo;s Black Is The New Black, which not only proved the band could still rock, but also that Everclear remains creatively relevant, decades after their platinum years. As is common for many artists these days, Black didn&rsquo;t set records for traditional album sales, but the release did see significant streaming activity and sparked a heightened social media presence, putting the group firmly back in the listening public&rsquo;s mind. The band continues to ride this latest wave of interest.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I personally think [Black] is one of the best records Everclear has ever made,&rdquo; Alexakis says. &ldquo;It sounds like both old Everclear and new Everclear: It has a contemporary production sound, but it&rsquo;s just old-school, angry rock songs. It&rsquo;s kind of dark, very reminiscent of the early stuff. The sales weren&rsquo;t great on it, but a lot of people streamed it. It got millions and millions of streams, so people were listening to it, and it resonated.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>But when you&rsquo;ve been a prolific band for more than a quarter-century, it&rsquo;s all part of the journey. Right now, Alexakis is feeling a reflective pull for the 25th anniversary of World Of Noise, the band&rsquo;s indie debut, which was recorded for $400 in a friend&rsquo;s basement in Portland. Although no official commemorative tour dates are confirmed as of this writing, Alexakis says he&rsquo;s considering playing some smaller, select shows this year as a tribute to the release. Much of the material rarely sees the light of day, but the 1993 album continues to enjoy a special place in Everclear history.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d just had a baby, I was on public assistance and was working part-time jobs, I was very frustrated and very angry and there were a lot of emotions going on,&rdquo; Alexakis reflects. &ldquo;I made that record for $400, because that&rsquo;s all I had. I got this guy who had a basement studio to give me 40 hours&rsquo; worth of recording at $10 an hour. We had 10 or 11 songs, so we went in and recorded them in a week and mixed them, and that&rsquo;s the album.&hellip;From there we just hit the ground running. I still haven&rsquo;t stopped.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>That rough and raw first attempt was just the nexus of the massive body of work Everclear and Alexakis have contributed since that humble beginning. When it comes to recording new material, at the moment Alexakis is focused primarily on writing and recording his first solo album, due out later this year. That precludes a new Everclear release&hellip;for now.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;We might make another record in a couple years,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Maybe later on this year I&rsquo;ll feel like it. I don&rsquo;t know yet.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>That said, the band&rsquo;s live itinerary certainly makes up for its recent studio absence. As the group prepares for another Summerland run, as well as numerous other future dates, Alexakis is excited to revisit songs from fan favorite records like Afterglow, Sparkle and Fade and the double album Songs From The American Movie, but also compositions from more underrated collections, like 2012&rsquo;s Invisible Stars.<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There are people asking for songs, so we&rsquo;ll just try and learn songs as we go,&rdquo; Alexakis says. &ldquo;If we get a lot of response from people to play a certain song, we&rsquo;re going to learn it and go on the road and play it. You don&rsquo;t think, &lsquo;Wow, I can&rsquo;t sing that high anymore.&rsquo; We&rsquo;re not going to worry about it. We&rsquo;re going to play some rock n&rsquo; roll, and just do it.&rdquo;<\/p>","tier":null,"axsTicketedEvent":true,"safetyIcons":[],"safetyModalEnabled":false,"fanSkins":[],"eventRedirect":{"enabled":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/festivals\/544106"},"description":null,"minorCategoryId1":"12","minorCategoryId1Label":"Rock","minorCategoryId2":"22","minorCategoryId2Label":"Hard Rock \/ Metal","minorCategoryId3":null,"minorCategoryId3Label":null,"majorCategoryId1":"2","majorCategoryId1Label":"Music","majorCategoryId2":"2","majorCategoryId2Label":"Music","majorCategoryId3":null,"majorCategoryId3Label":null,"venue":{"venueId":"125119","active":true,"distanceMiles":null,"distanceKilometers":null,"locale":"en-US","localeAvailable":{"1":"en-US"},"title":"The National","address_line":"708 East Broad Street, Richmond, VA 23219","address":"708 East Broad Street","city":"Richmond","state":"VA","postalCode":"23219","country":"United States","countryCode":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/venues\/125119\/the-national-richmond-tickets","safetyIcons":[],"safetyIconUrl":null,"safetyModalEnabled":false,"urlSlug":"the-national-richmond-tickets","venueUrl":"http:\/\/www.thenationalva.com\/","phone1":"(804) 612-1900","phone2":null,"alias":null,"parking":"<p>Parking decks are directly behind the venue as well as metered street parking within walking distance of the venue.<\/p>","boxOffice":"<p>The National Box Office is open Monday through Friday between 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.<\/p>\r\n<p>The National Box Office is also open 2 hours before show time the night of the show.<\/p>","directions":null,"longitude":"-77.43518499999","latitude":"37.5419244","timezone":"America\/New_York","ada":null,"keywords":["Richmond","Richmond VA"],"skinCode":null,"currency":"USD","media":{"10":{"media_id":"1359429","width":318,"height":187,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2015\/06\/the-national_richmond_06-18-15_10_5582ea7befa42.jpg"},"12":{"media_id":"1359430","width":134,"height":79,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2015\/06\/the-national_richmond_06-18-15_12_5582ea7c96f15.jpg"},"11":{"media_id":"1359431","width":238,"height":140,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2015\/06\/the-national_richmond_06-18-15_11_5582ea7d0fdec.jpg"},"21":{"media_id":"1359433","width":678,"height":399,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2015\/06\/the-national_richmond_06-18-15_21_5582ea7ddb3fe.jpg"},"22":{"media_id":"1359434","width":564,"height":564,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2015\/06\/the-national_richmond_06-18-15_22_5582ea7e48fa9.jpg"},"60":{"media_id":"1359435","width":322,"height":322,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2015\/06\/the-national_richmond_06-18-15_60_5582ea7eaaff3.jpg"},"61":{"media_id":"1359436","width":220,"height":220,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2015\/06\/the-national_richmond_06-18-15_61_5582ea7f1efa2.jpg"},"14":{"media_id":"1367958","width":608,"height":252,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2015\/06\/the-national_richmond_06-23-15_14_5589db7902203.jpg"}},"links":[{"link_id":1109271,"link_title":"Directions","link_type_id":"45","link_href":"http:\/\/www.thenationalva.com\/venue-info","link_target":"_blank"},{"link_id":1109276,"link_title":"Facebook Page Co-Host","link_type_id":"24","link_href":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bowerypresents\/","link_target":"_blank"},{"link_id":1109273,"link_title":"Parking","link_type_id":"17","link_href":"http:\/\/www.thenationalva.com\/venue-info","link_target":"_blank"},{"link_id":1109274,"link_title":"Lodging","link_type_id":"23","link_href":"http:\/\/www.trivago.com\/?cip=1090752040101&cip_tc=getsleep","link_target":"_blank"},{"link_id":1109275,"link_title":"Terms of Service","link_type_id":"18","link_href":"http:\/\/www.thenationalva.com\/faq","link_target":"_blank"},{"link_id":1109277,"link_title":"FAQ","link_type_id":"52","link_href":"https:\/\/www.thenationalva.com\/faq","link_target":"_blank"}],"axs_ticketed_venue":true,"tier":null,"eventDisplay":1},"tour":[],"promoters":[{"promoterId":"84","promoterName":"The Bowery Presents","imageUrl":null}],"associations":{"performerIds":["495","212276","768410"],"headliners":[{"performerId":"495","active":true,"locale":"en-US","localeAvailable":{"1":"en-US"},"name":"Everclear","under21":false,"minorCategoryText":"Rock","minorCategoryId":"12","minorCategory1Id":"12","minorCategory2Text":"Hard Rock \/ Metal","minorCategory2Id":"22","minorCategory3Text":null,"minorCategory3Id":null,"minorCategoryUrl":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/browse\/music\/rock","majorCategoryText":"Music","majorCategory2Text":"Music","majorCategory3Text":null,"major_category_id":"2","majorCategory1Id":"2","majorCategory2Id":"2","majorCategory3Id":null,"majorCategoryUrl":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/browse\/music","keywords":[],"createFacebookEvent":true,"bio":"<p>Art Alexakis &ndash;

over 30 years, Josh Davis has expressed his passion, taste, and values through the music<\/p>\r\n<p>he creates as DJ Shadow. The name alone evokes a high watermark for instrumental hip-hop<\/p>\r\n<p>and composition. From his first masterpiece Endtroducing&hellip;, to the genre-hopping UNKLE<\/p>\r\n<p>release Psyence Fiction, to the otherworldly elegance of The Private Press and its iconic single<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Six Days,&rdquo; to his underrated Bay Area celebration The Outsider, his work in the &lsquo;90s and first<\/p>\r\n<p>decade of the 2000s is as essential as it is hard-to-pin-down. In the 2010s, Shadow released<\/p>\r\n<p>the sprawling The Less You Know, the Better, with its muscular forays into rock music, and<\/p>\r\n<p>closed the decade with The Mountain Will Fall and Our Pathetic Age, both very ambitious,<\/p>\r\n<p>risk-taking albums that boasted some of his best rap collaborations by working with Run the<\/p>\r\n<p>Jewels, Nas, and De La Soul, among others. If there&rsquo;s a single red thread across this career, it's<\/p>\r\n<p>his restless ear, always searching to rescue some forgotten gem from the dustbin of music<\/p>\r\n<p>history or a fresh blast of sound from the cutting edge.<\/p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a practice Shadow learned as a young boy, enamored with collecting comic books, baseball<\/p>\r\n<p>cards, 12-inch records, and precious songs captured to cassette from the radio airwaves late at<\/p>\r\n<p>night in northern California. With great seriousness and love, he will describe the second-hand<\/p>\r\n<p>transistor AM radio on which he first heard Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five&rsquo;s &ldquo;The<\/p>\r\n<p>Message,&rdquo; when he was 10 years old. Or his mind-expanding encounter with Public Enemy&rsquo;s<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Rebel Without a Pause&rdquo; and that single&rsquo;s howling saxophone blast. At the heart of DJ Shadow&rsquo;s<\/p>\r\n<p>musical project is deep listening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always trying to please or impress the most advanced<\/p>\r\n<p>listener,&rdquo; he says. The type of aficionado who will respect the layers upon layers of synth that<\/p>\r\n<p>went into making a sound that can&rsquo;t be readily identified but will make you want to share the<\/p>\r\n<p>track with a friend and say, &ldquo;This part right here.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The first sampled words heard on DJ Shadow&rsquo;s forthcoming album Action Adventure, his<\/p>\r\n<p>seventh solo LP, are &ldquo;all my records and tapes.&rdquo; In fact, they are some of the only words heard<\/p>\r\n<p>on what is almost an entirely instrumental release; they&rsquo;re a kind of thesis statement for an<\/p>\r\n<p>album that has its roots in the drifting, destabilizing days of the COVID lockdown. Action<\/p>\r\n<p>Adventure is an inward-looking project, made by Shadow alone without any collaborators.<\/p>\r\n<p>Action Adventure tells the listener: &ldquo;This is about my relationship to music. My life as a collector<\/p>\r\n<p>and curator. All my records and tapes, and no one else&rsquo;s.&rdquo; The result is the most exciting DJ<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ozone Scraper&rdquo; kicks off the album without preamble, just big, propulsive drums. It has the<\/p>\r\n<p>feeling of transportation, of jet engines lifting the passenger somewhere impossible. One of his<\/p>\r\n<p>favorites on Action Adventure, &ldquo;Ozone Scraper&rdquo; is an invitation to strap in and also sets the<\/p>\r\n<p>table for the kind of deep listening Shadow loves. The advanced listeners will marvel at the kind<\/p>\r\n<p>of &ldquo;special effects,&rdquo; as Shadow puts it, that went into creating the elusive synth noises. Like a<\/p>\r\n<p>child marveling at a summer blockbuster, you wonder: How did he do this?<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You Played Me&rdquo; is a miracle that happened by pure chance. Inspired by the eBay tapes,<\/p>\r\n<p>Shadow created a beat that had the crackling percussion and burbling synths of classic &lsquo;80s<\/p>\r\n<p>R&amp;B, like a lost Ren&eacute; and Angela hit. &ldquo;I loaded up the instrumental and looped it on my<\/p>\r\n<p>computer to play forever,&rdquo; he explains. Then he started auditioning records in his collection that<\/p>\r\n<p>he hadn&rsquo;t processed yet&mdash;an experiment to find the vocal in the haystack. &ldquo;I dropped the needle<\/p>\r\n<p>on an acapella of a really obscure R&amp;B 12-inch from around &lsquo;84, &lsquo;85 and I thought, &lsquo;That<\/p>\r\n<p>actually works.&rsquo;&rdquo; Still, he wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure, and he sent the song to his label as a reference<\/p>\r\n<p>for a potential collaboration&hellip; whoever it was needed to have this sound, Shadow told them.<\/p>\r\n<p>After a few weeks, though, he realized he already had what he needed&mdash;the acapella was<\/p>\r\n<p>correct. &ldquo;It's an example of one of my favorite aspects of the music I make, which is just 100%<\/p>\r\n<p>serendipity,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There are a thousand records sitting next to me that aren't going to work;<\/p>\r\n<p>the right record got put on at the right moment to change the course of my album. It&rsquo;s one of my<\/p>\r\n<p>favorite songs I&rsquo;ve ever made.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The album has a cinematic quality, especially in its sequencing. The last quarter, from &ldquo;Fleeting<\/p>\r\n<p>Youth&rdquo; through &ldquo;Reflecting Pool&rdquo; and &ldquo;Forever Changed,&rdquo; is as cathartic as a well-told story, and<\/p>\r\n<p>ends on a triumphant note, with &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Evolving.&rdquo; The oldest recording on Action Adventure, it&rsquo;s<\/p>\r\n<p>another happy accident that nearly didn&rsquo;t make the album. Initially Shadow doubted including a<\/p>\r\n<p>song from the cursed early days of lockdown and planned to end the album with a much sadder<\/p>\r\n<p>track. But it didn&rsquo;t sit right and he kept returning to &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Evolving&rdquo;&mdash;until it stuck.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The title Action Adventure evokes the halcyon days of video store browsing, and it&rsquo;s fitting that shadow LP in years.<\/p>\r\n<p>In March 2020, Shadow narrowly escaped from the European tour for his double-disc release<\/p>\r\n<p>Our Pathetic Age, landing back home in the Bay Area as the world shuttered. He watched his<\/p>\r\n<p>two teenage daughters endure homeschooling and tried to process his own emotions about the<\/p>\r\n<p>tour cut short; an album he was proud of that didn&rsquo;t get to have its moment in public. &ldquo;It was a<\/p>\r\n<p>very intense time,&rdquo; he recalls. For over a year, he couldn&rsquo;t imagine making any new music, or<\/p>\r\n<p>even listening to any contemporary music. &ldquo;It was as if the music coming out was somehow<\/p>\r\n<p>tainted by the craziness we were living through, the chaos and upheaval. I needed to<\/p>\r\n<p>temporarily wallow in a bit of nostalgia, and not necessarily songs I knew&rdquo;&mdash;but music from a<\/p>\r\n<p>time period that felt less fraught.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Around this same time, in 2021, a friend directed Shadow to an eBay auction of about 200 tapes<\/p>\r\n<p>that were recorded off the radio from a mix station that serviced the Baltimore-D.C. area in the<\/p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;80s. During that time, he taped Bay Area radio mixes and was able to get his hands on New<\/p>\r\n<p>York mixes as well, but these mixes felt entirely unique in their blend of dance music, R&amp;B, and<\/p>\r\n<p>early hip-hop. They had a youthful, &ldquo;we know no limits&rdquo; quality that invigorated Shadow at a time<\/p>\r\n<p>when he desperately needed it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Shadow began work on Action Adventure on January 1, 2022, and the early tracks pushed him<\/p>\r\n<p>further into his compositional bag. &ldquo;I didn't want to write music that was formatted for vocalists. I<\/p>\r\n<p>wanted to write music that flexed different energies,&rdquo; he says. Though he isn&rsquo;t classically<\/p>\r\n<p>trained, he asked himself questions like &ldquo;which chord progression would be most natural here,<\/p>\r\n<p>and which would be least predictable?&rdquo; and worked according to the inner logic that felt right to<\/p>\r\n<p>him. His rule for the record was simple: no compromises. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m entering my fourth decade doing<\/p>\r\n<p>this&mdash;what do I want to represent? I know that I don&rsquo;t want to only make beats for some<\/p>\r\n<p>potential vocalist that I&rsquo;ve never met, and who may not share my vision. I want this record to<\/p>\r\n<p>stand or fall on my own credentials.&rdquo;<\/p>","tier":null,"axsTicketedEvent":true,"safetyIcons":[],"safetyModalEnabled":false,"fanSkins":[],"eventRedirect":{"enabled":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/festivals\/542690"},"description":null,"minorCategoryId1":"17","minorCategoryId1Label":"Dance

over 30 years, Josh Davis has expressed his passion, taste, and values through the music<\/p>\r\n<p>he creates as DJ Shadow. The name alone evokes a high watermark for instrumental hip-hop<\/p>\r\n<p>and composition. From his first masterpiece Endtroducing&hellip;, to the genre-hopping UNKLE<\/p>\r\n<p>release Psyence Fiction, to the otherworldly elegance of The Private Press and its iconic single<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Six Days,&rdquo; to his underrated Bay Area celebration The Outsider, his work in the &lsquo;90s and first<\/p>\r\n<p>decade of the 2000s is as essential as it is hard-to-pin-down. In the 2010s, Shadow released<\/p>\r\n<p>the sprawling The Less You Know, the Better, with its muscular forays into rock music, and<\/p>\r\n<p>closed the decade with The Mountain Will Fall and Our Pathetic Age, both very ambitious,<\/p>\r\n<p>risk-taking albums that boasted some of his best rap collaborations by working with Run the<\/p>\r\n<p>Jewels, Nas, and De La Soul, among others. If there&rsquo;s a single red thread across this career, it's<\/p>\r\n<p>his restless ear, always searching to rescue some forgotten gem from the dustbin of music<\/p>\r\n<p>history or a fresh blast of sound from the cutting edge.<\/p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a practice Shadow learned as a young boy, enamored with collecting comic books, baseball<\/p>\r\n<p>cards, 12-inch records, and precious songs captured to cassette from the radio airwaves late at<\/p>\r\n<p>night in northern California. With great seriousness and love, he will describe the second-hand<\/p>\r\n<p>transistor AM radio on which he first heard Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five&rsquo;s &ldquo;The<\/p>\r\n<p>Message,&rdquo; when he was 10 years old. Or his mind-expanding encounter with Public Enemy&rsquo;s<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Rebel Without a Pause&rdquo; and that single&rsquo;s howling saxophone blast. At the heart of DJ Shadow&rsquo;s<\/p>\r\n<p>musical project is deep listening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always trying to please or impress the most advanced<\/p>\r\n<p>listener,&rdquo; he says. The type of aficionado who will respect the layers upon layers of synth that<\/p>\r\n<p>went into making a sound that can&rsquo;t be readily identified but will make you want to share the<\/p>\r\n<p>track with a friend and say, &ldquo;This part right here.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The first sampled words heard on DJ Shadow&rsquo;s forthcoming album Action Adventure, his<\/p>\r\n<p>seventh solo LP, are &ldquo;all my records and tapes.&rdquo; In fact, they are some of the only words heard<\/p>\r\n<p>on what is almost an entirely instrumental release; they&rsquo;re a kind of thesis statement for an<\/p>\r\n<p>album that has its roots in the drifting, destabilizing days of the COVID lockdown. Action<\/p>\r\n<p>Adventure is an inward-looking project, made by Shadow alone without any collaborators.<\/p>\r\n<p>Action Adventure tells the listener: &ldquo;This is about my relationship to music. My life as a collector<\/p>\r\n<p>and curator. All my records and tapes, and no one else&rsquo;s.&rdquo; The result is the most exciting DJ<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ozone Scraper&rdquo; kicks off the album without preamble, just big, propulsive drums. It has the<\/p>\r\n<p>feeling of transportation, of jet engines lifting the passenger somewhere impossible. One of his<\/p>\r\n<p>favorites on Action Adventure, &ldquo;Ozone Scraper&rdquo; is an invitation to strap in and also sets the<\/p>\r\n<p>table for the kind of deep listening Shadow loves. The advanced listeners will marvel at the kind<\/p>\r\n<p>of &ldquo;special effects,&rdquo; as Shadow puts it, that went into creating the elusive synth noises. Like a<\/p>\r\n<p>child marveling at a summer blockbuster, you wonder: How did he do this?<\/p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;You Played Me&rdquo; is a miracle that happened by pure chance. Inspired by the eBay tapes,<\/p>\r\n<p>Shadow created a beat that had the crackling percussion and burbling synths of classic &lsquo;80s<\/p>\r\n<p>R&amp;B, like a lost Ren&eacute; and Angela hit. &ldquo;I loaded up the instrumental and looped it on my<\/p>\r\n<p>computer to play forever,&rdquo; he explains. Then he started auditioning records in his collection that<\/p>\r\n<p>he hadn&rsquo;t processed yet&mdash;an experiment to find the vocal in the haystack. &ldquo;I dropped the needle<\/p>\r\n<p>on an acapella of a really obscure R&amp;B 12-inch from around &lsquo;84, &lsquo;85 and I thought, &lsquo;That<\/p>\r\n<p>actually works.&rsquo;&rdquo; Still, he wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure, and he sent the song to his label as a reference<\/p>\r\n<p>for a potential collaboration&hellip; whoever it was needed to have this sound, Shadow told them.<\/p>\r\n<p>After a few weeks, though, he realized he already had what he needed&mdash;the acapella was<\/p>\r\n<p>correct. &ldquo;It's an example of one of my favorite aspects of the music I make, which is just 100%<\/p>\r\n<p>serendipity,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There are a thousand records sitting next to me that aren't going to work;<\/p>\r\n<p>the right record got put on at the right moment to change the course of my album. It&rsquo;s one of my<\/p>\r\n<p>favorite songs I&rsquo;ve ever made.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>The album has a cinematic quality, especially in its sequencing. The last quarter, from &ldquo;Fleeting<\/p>\r\n<p>Youth&rdquo; through &ldquo;Reflecting Pool&rdquo; and &ldquo;Forever Changed,&rdquo; is as cathartic as a well-told story, and<\/p>\r\n<p>ends on a triumphant note, with &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Evolving.&rdquo; The oldest recording on Action Adventure, it&rsquo;s<\/p>\r\n<p>another happy accident that nearly didn&rsquo;t make the album. Initially Shadow doubted including a<\/p>\r\n<p>song from the cursed early days of lockdown and planned to end the album with a much sadder<\/p>\r\n<p>track. But it didn&rsquo;t sit right and he kept returning to &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Evolving&rdquo;&mdash;until it stuck.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The title Action Adventure evokes the halcyon days of video store browsing, and it&rsquo;s fitting that shadow LP in years.<\/p>\r\n<p>In March 2020, Shadow narrowly escaped from the European tour for his double-disc release<\/p>\r\n<p>Our Pathetic Age, landing back home in the Bay Area as the world shuttered. He watched his<\/p>\r\n<p>two teenage daughters endure homeschooling and tried to process his own emotions about the<\/p>\r\n<p>tour cut short; an album he was proud of that didn&rsquo;t get to have its moment in public. &ldquo;It was a<\/p>\r\n<p>very intense time,&rdquo; he recalls. For over a year, he couldn&rsquo;t imagine making any new music, or<\/p>\r\n<p>even listening to any contemporary music. &ldquo;It was as if the music coming out was somehow<\/p>\r\n<p>tainted by the craziness we were living through, the chaos and upheaval. I needed to<\/p>\r\n<p>temporarily wallow in a bit of nostalgia, and not necessarily songs I knew&rdquo;&mdash;but music from a<\/p>\r\n<p>time period that felt less fraught.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Around this same time, in 2021, a friend directed Shadow to an eBay auction of about 200 tapes<\/p>\r\n<p>that were recorded off the radio from a mix station that serviced the Baltimore-D.C. area in the<\/p>\r\n<p>&lsquo;80s. During that time, he taped Bay Area radio mixes and was able to get his hands on New<\/p>\r\n<p>York mixes as well, but these mixes felt entirely unique in their blend of dance music, R&amp;B, and<\/p>\r\n<p>early hip-hop. They had a youthful, &ldquo;we know no limits&rdquo; quality that invigorated Shadow at a time<\/p>\r\n<p>when he desperately needed it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Shadow began work on Action Adventure on January 1, 2022, and the early tracks pushed him<\/p>\r\n<p>further into his compositional bag. &ldquo;I didn't want to write music that was formatted for vocalists. I<\/p>\r\n<p>wanted to write music that flexed different energies,&rdquo; he says. Though he isn&rsquo;t classically<\/p>\r\n<p>trained, he asked himself questions like &ldquo;which chord progression would be most natural here,<\/p>\r\n<p>and which would be least predictable?&rdquo; and worked according to the inner logic that felt right to<\/p>\r\n<p>him. His rule for the record was simple: no compromises. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m entering my fourth decade doing<\/p>\r\n<p>this&mdash;what do I want to represent? I know that I don&rsquo;t want to only make beats for some<\/p>\r\n<p>potential vocalist that I&rsquo;ve never met, and who may not share my vision. I want this record to<\/p>\r\n<p>stand or fall on my own credentials.&rdquo;<\/p>","shortBio":null,"aliases":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.axs.com\/artists\/104140\/dj-shadow-tickets","urlSlug":"dj-shadow-tickets","externalPartnerID":{},"media":{"19":{"media_id":4801450,"width":678,"height":399,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/10\/dj-shadow_10-30-23_19_653fe2f8d8e59.jpg"},"5":{"media_id":4801451,"width":318,"height":187,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/10\/dj-shadow_10-30-23_5_653fe2f917ba7.jpg"},"6":{"media_id":4801452,"width":238,"height":140,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/10\/dj-shadow_10-30-23_6_653fe2f94d25d.jpg"},"9":{"media_id":4801453,"width":134,"height":79,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/10\/dj-shadow_10-30-23_9_653fe2f969062.jpg"},"20":{"media_id":4801454,"width":564,"height":564,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/10\/dj-shadow_10-30-23_20_653fe2f98c166.jpg"},"7":{"media_id":4801455,"width":220,"height":220,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/10\/dj-shadow_10-30-23_7_653fe2f9c3c9e.jpg"},"24":{"media_id":4801456,"width":322,"height":322,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/10\/dj-shadow_10-30-23_24_653fe2f9e2128.jpg"},"88":{"media_id":4801457,"width":1200,"height":628,"file_name":"https:\/\/images.discovery-prod.axs.com\/2023\/10\/dj-shadow_10-30-23_88_653fe2fa1de08.jpg"}},"city":null,"state":null,"country":"United

always lures Ricky Montgomery back. He blames the internet. First a devotee of the Vine underground, and now&mdash;nearly a decade and several jobs later&mdash;an unexpected hitmaker, the Los Angeles native has spent the last few years trying to reconcile with his artist self. He recently surpassed 1 billion global streams thanks to Platinum indie-pop hits &ldquo;Mr. Loverman&rdquo; and &ldquo;Line Without a Hook.&rdquo; But those songs, written when he was a teen, have come to feel like they were by a whole other person&mdash;at least to Ricky. In 2023, we get to meet Rick, a sophomore set that comes seven years later, rich with electro-laced, emo-tinged alt-pop that spins stories about life in all its messy and mundane glory. Ricky's journey fits the bill: a childhood in L.A. interrupted by divorce, an adolescence playing in the basement bands of suburban Missouri, a viral explosion on a soon-to-implode platform, and a brief music career back on the West Coast that sent his songs up the Rock and Alternative charts.

He blames the internet. First a devotee of the Vine underground, and now&mdash;nearly a decade and several jobs later&mdash;an unexpected hitmaker, the Los Angeles native has spent the last few years trying to reconcile with his artist self. He recently surpassed 1 billion global streams thanks to Platinum indie-pop hits &ldquo;Mr. Loverman&rdquo; and &ldquo;Line Without a Hook.&rdquo; But those songs, written when he was a teen, have come to feel like they were by a whole other person&mdash;at least to Ricky. In 2023, we get to meet Rick, a sophomore set that comes seven years later, rich with electro-laced, emo-tinged alt-pop that spins stories about life in all its messy and mundane glory. Ricky's journey fits the bill: a childhood in L.A. interrupted by divorce, an adolescence playing in the basement bands of suburban Missouri, a viral explosion on a soon-to-implode platform, and a brief music career back on the West Coast that sent his songs up the Rock and Alternative charts. That was in 2014, before life intervened and he quit music for good&hellip; until the world discovered his sunny, sardonic songs. With millions of social followers and a string of sold-out tours under his belt, Ricky now sets out to document \"my long, awkward path toward remembering myself as an artist,\" he says. \"It&rsquo;s been embarrassing and difficult, but also thrilling.
